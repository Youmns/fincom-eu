        target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Plus500</a></strong> is facing
        renewed shareholder unrest over its executive pay policies, with a
        majority of investors voting against the company’s remuneration report
        for the second consecutive year.</p> <p class="" data-start="443"
        data-end="734">According to a disclosure filed with the London Stock
        Exchange, 51% of shareholders opposed the 2024 remuneration report
        during the company’s annual general meeting (AGM). This marks another
        significant blow for the trading platform, following a 65.8% vote
        against executive pay in 2023.</p> <p class="" data-start="736"
        data-end="985">The opposition centers around compensation awarded to CEO
        David Zruia and CFO Elad Even-Chen, who each received nearly $5 million
        in pay packages last year, up from $3.7 million previously, despite a
        mixed performance across recent quarters.</p> <p class=""
        data-start="987" data-end="1220">The AGM also revealed that 22% of
        shareholders voted against reappointing Steve Baldwin as a non-executive
        director. While the motion passed, the level of dissent underscores
        ongoing dissatisfaction with the company’s governance.</p> <p class=""
        data-start="1222" data-end="1508">Despite these concerns, Plus500 raised
        its 2025 outlook, even as its Q1 results painted a complex picture.
        Revenue increased 13% quarter-on-quarter but declined 5% year-on-year.
        EBITDA climbed 23% over the previous quarter, though it was still 9%
        lower than the same period in 2024.</p> <p class="" data-start="1510"
        data-end="1782">Customer engagement metrics revealed further challenges.
        The platform attracted 26,897 new users in Q1, a decline from over
        36,000 in Q4 2024. Active users also fell 4% to 130,514. However,
        average deposit per user surged to $12,450, more than double the prior
        figure.</p> <p class="" data-start="1784" data-end="2126">In response to
        the shareholder vote, the Plus500 board stated it is taking the feedback
        seriously and plans to continue engaging with stakeholders to improve
        corporate governance and executive pay practices. The board emphasized
        that shareholder input will shape future decisions and acknowledged the
        company’s unique operating structure.</p> <p class="" data-start="2128"
        data-end="2374">In early 2025, Plus500 became a clearing member of ICE
        Clear US, aiming to reduce trading costs and expand services. The
        company also secured a UAE regulatory license, enabling it to offer
        futures and stock trading products in the region.</p> <p class=""
        data-start="2376" data-end="2640">Plus500 reported record growth in its
        B2B and retail futures trading segments, driven by its flagship product,
        Plus500 Futures. The company further expanded by entering the Japanese
        market with a localized trading platform tailored to retail
        investors.</p> <p class="" data-start="2642" data-end="2956">Meanwhile,
        the broker continues to strengthen its regulatory footprint. It received
        a license from the Securities Commission of the Bahamas in July 2023 and
        has since reported promising growth in the Middle East, particularly
        after obtaining approval from the Dubai Financial Services
        Authority<strong data-start="2910" data-end="2955"> (<a

        has announced the rollout of its Copy Trading feature on the Vantage
        Client Portal website, expanding browser-based access to a tool that was
        previously limited to its mobile app. This development enhances
        accessibility across the broker’s supported regions and offers both new
        and existing clients the ability to replicate strategies from
        top-performing traders directly through the web platform.</p> <p
        class="" data-start="632" data-end="972">To support the launch, Vantage
        has introduced a deposit bonus promotion, allowing eligible users to
        receive up to 50% in credit bonus when opening a Copy Trading account
        via the Client Portal. The feature enables users to mirror trades from
        seasoned signal providers in real-time, eliminating the need for
        advanced market knowledge.</p> <h2 data-start="974"

        data-start="1033" data-end="1430">Marc Despallieres, CEO of Vantage
        Markets, commented, “At Vantage, we are continuously working to
        democratize access to financial markets. By bringing Copy Trading to our
        Client Portal, we’re providing greater flexibility and convenience for
        our users. This expansion reflects our commitment to innovation and
        helping traders – both new and experienced – make more informed trading
        decisions, with the tools and support they need.”</p> <p class=""
        data-start="1432" data-end="1757">The web-based Copy Trading platform
        replicates the core functionality of its mobile counterpart. It includes
        rapid account registration, integrated TradingView charting tools, and
        access to daily market analysis. Traders can engage with US stock CFDs
        commission-free, though standard trading fees may still apply.</p> <p
        class="" data-start="1759" data-end="2102">The company has framed Copy
        Trading as an entry point for those looking to diversify their
        strategies or engage with financial markets through the expertise of
        professional traders. By integrating the feature into the Client Portal,
        Vantage aims to simplify onboarding and increase its prominence within
        the broker’s broader trading ecosystem.</p> <p class=""
        data-start="2104" data-end="2453">Users who open Copy Trading accounts
        through the web platform gain access to a suite of resources including
        technical indicators, real-time tracking of trades, and Vantage’s
        in-house market research and analysis. The broker says these tools are
        designed to boost trader confidence while providing a transparent view
        of live trading activity.</p> <p class="" data-start="2455"
        data-end="2806">Vantage Markets offers multi-asset trading across a
        broad range of CFDs, including Forex, commodities, indices, ETFs,
        equities, and bonds. The broker supports both web and mobile trading
        experiences, delivers over 220 product analyses daily, and continues to
        emphasize user education and intuitive trading environments.</p>
