        target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted an update</a> on their financial
        metrics for the first half of 2020. The brokerage announced that its
        operating revenues have jumped 38.9% to CHF 162.7 million in the first
        half of 2020 as compared to the same period last year.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">Net revenues for the broker amounted to CHF
        160.7 million, which is an increase of 43.2% from the previous year. The
        company indicated that this growth was driven primarily by fees and
        commissions income and eForex, with the previous gaining 82.7% year over
        year and the latter 52.2%.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">As with
        other brokers, SwissQuote experienced a massive spike in trader activity
        with 57K+ new accounts added during the period, which client assets grew
        9.7% to CHF 33.5 billion. With this growth the broker expects to
        generate total revenues of CHF 300 million for the year and a pre-tax
        profit of CHF 100 million. Nonetheless, it remains to be seen if trader
        activity will continue to be elevated as market volatility has subsided
        in the near term and Covid-19 disruptions continue to impact markets and
        economies.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t miss the latest

        unrest caused by the results of the presidential elections in the
        Republic of Belarus, access to the global Internet was turned off
        throughout the country, which, in turn, stopped the operations of almost
        all forex companies. The website of the Belarusian Currency and Stock
        Exchange is also unavailable.</p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;">Yesterday morning, the largest representative of the
        over-the-counter Belarusian sector, licensed forex dealer MTBankFX,
        published an announcement, informing the public about problems with
        connecting to trading terminals due to interruptions in access to the
        Internet. Today (August 11, 2020), the websites of almost all Belarusian
        forex companies are unavailable.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">The
        onliner.by portal published an official comment from Beltelecom: “Over
        the past 24 hours, the company&#8217;s systems have been recording
        multiple cyberattacks of varying intensity on the websites of government
        agencies and Beltelecom resources. This led to a significant overload of
        channels, failure, and breakdown of telecommunication equipment and, as
        a result, difficulties with access for subscribers to certain resources
        and services of the Internet.&#8221;</p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;">Also, experts with a high degree of probability assume that
        interruptions with the Internet connection will last at least until the
        end of this week.</p> ]]></content:encoded

        ><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The large institutional
        brokerage Interactive Brokers LLC, based in the United States has been
        fined by US regulatory authorities for AML and reporting failures,
        according to the US <a
        href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-178" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) notice</a>,
        published today.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">The SEC reported that “Interactive Brokers
        LLC will pay an $11.5 million penalty to settle charges it repeatedly
        failed to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) for U.S. microcap
        securities trades it executed on behalf of its customers. In parallel
        actions, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the
        Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced settlements
        with Interactive Brokers related to anti-money laundering failures in
        which the registered broker-dealer agreed to pay penalties of $15
        million and $11.5 million, respectively, for a total of $38 million in
        penalties paid to the three agencies.”</p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;"> <p style="text-align: justify;">The SEC’s order finds that
        Interactive Brokers violated the financial recordkeeping and reporting
        provisions of the federal securities laws and a related SEC rule.
        Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, Interactive Brokers
        agreed to be censured, to cease and desist, and to pay an $11.5 million
        penalty. In its settlements with FINRA and the CFTC, Interactive Brokers
        agreed to retain an independent compliance consultant and to disgorge
        certain profits in addition to the penalties assessed by those
        agencies.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> <p style="text-align:
        justify;">This case highlights how important compliance and reporting
        standards are in regulated jurisdictions. Oftentimes keeping up with
        proper filings and procedures is a costly process, but it must
        ultimately be done in order to avoid such penalties. Our Financial
        Commission partners are able to help ensure brokers’ satisfy such
        regulatory requirements &#8211; <a

        href="https://financefeeds.com/pepperstone-data-leak-kudos-handling-correctly/"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Finance Feeds</i></a>, the broker’s
        handling of the situation sets a standard for how large and renowned FX
        companies should handle such situations.</p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;"> <p style="text-align: justify;">As <a
        href="../../../pepperstone-warns-customers-of-clones.html">we previously
        reported</a>, Pepperstone experienced a data breach on 20 July which
        impacted some customer details and information and led to unknown 3rd
        party individuals calling Pepperstone customers directly in order to
        entice fraudulent transfers and withdrawals of funds.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;"> <p style="text-align: justify;">In its
        notice to customers, Pepperstone said the security issue originated from
        one of its 3rd party vendors after cybercriminals used malware to
        compromise its computers and obtained access to the provider’s
        credentials. The intruders then used those credentials to gain some
        access to Pepperstone’s internal client relationship management system
        (CRM). The broker has assured customers that only the name, contact
        details including address, date of birth, and security questions and

        ><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">According to our colleagues at
        Finance Magnates, several brokers, including <a
        href="https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/brokers/gmo-clicks-july-fx-volume-dips-as-covid-19-volatility-vanishes/"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">GMO Click</a> and <a
        href="https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/brokers/saxo-bank-reports-mom-decline-in-fx-volumes-in-july/"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saxo Bank</a> have reported a drop in
        July trading volumes following the extreme market volatility witnessed
        this spring following the spread of Covid-19 globally. While the FX
        markets can normally experience a slowdown in summer months, the drop in
        volumes is exacerbated by the record trading volumes achieved in March
        and the following months by many international online brokerages.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;"> <p style="text-align: justify;">GMO Click,
        based in Japan, reported that their FX Neo platform recorded a total
        exchange volume of 105 trillion yen in foreign currencies, compared to
        124 trillion yen in total volume in June, which is a 15.3% decline month
        over month. The broker indicated that they achieved a peak in volumes in
        March 2020 when trading activity surged across the world. The broker
        recorded 189 trillion yen in trading during that month. Nevertheless,
        when looking at 2019 data, the broker still achieved a 102% growth when
        comparing the same monthly data, which is certainly very positive.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> <p style="text-align:
        justify;">European Saxo Bank experienced similar performance, with July
        forex trading volumes falling 14.1% to $138.6 billion, as compared to
        $161.4 the month before. On an annualized basis the broker failed to
        achieve the growth experienced by GMO Click, with 2020 July numbers
        being 10.5 stronger than the same period in 2019. Nonetheless, the
        Danish broker was able to grow commodities trading volumes by a whopping
        81.3% from June to July 2020 and 18.2% on an annualized basis suggesting
        that traders are looking to speculate on the most dynamic markets
        available.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> Don’t miss the latest
