        ><![CDATA[<p>Moomoo, a prominent trading platform, partnered with Cboe
        Global Markets to release the 2024 Options Trader Survey, which reveals
        a surge in options trading interest among retail investors.</p>
        <p><strong>Growing Popularity of Options Trading</strong></p> <p>The
        survey shows a significant rise in options trading adoption among retail
        investors, with many embracing basic options strategies and aiming to
        learn more advanced techniques. Findings highlight that retail traders
        are actively seeking ways to enhance their skills and knowledge in this
        area.</p> <p><strong>Nearly Half of Retail Investors Trade Options
        Regularly</strong></p> <p>Conducted in September 2024 with over 1,000
        participants, the survey found that 67% of respondents have been trading
        options for under three years. Nearly half of these investors engage in
        options trading on a daily or weekly basis, with 43% trading Zero
        Days-to-Expiration (0DTE) options, a rapidly growing trend in the
        options market.</p> <p>Income generation (67%) and risk management were
        cited as primary reasons for retail interest in options. Factors such as
        lower trading fees, greater access to financial information, and
        advanced analytical tools also drive the popularity of options trading.
        The survey underscores the importance of educational resources, with
        many traders seeking better tools to refine their strategies and
        understanding.</p> <p>Cboe contributed data to enrich the survey
        insights, highlighting the growth potential in options trading as retail
        investors increase their engagement. Moomoo is committed to supporting
        this community by providing free educational tools, resources, and
        interactive learning events.</p> <p>Neil McDonald, CEO of Moomoo US,
        commented, “Options trading interest has reached an all-time high. As a
        veteran in derivatives trading, I’m excited to see retail investors
        accessing rich data and tools. At Moomoo, we’re dedicated to offering
        top educational resources to support the retail investment
        community.”</p> <p><strong>Cboe Expands with VIX Futures
        Options</strong></p> <p>This month, Cboe introduced options on the Cboe
        Volatility Index (VIX) futures. The options are based on front-month VIX
        futures, enabling investors to manage market volatility. With futures as
        the underlying asset, these options will be regulated by the CFTC,
        offering access to a broader range of market participants who may be
        restricted from securities-based options.</p> <p>The options on VIX
        futures, which are European-style and physically settle into front-month
        VIX futures, are expected to complement existing VIX Index options. This
        provides customers with more expiration date choices and additional
        tools for tailored hedging strategies. Options on VIX futures join a
        lineup of Cboe’s volatility products, including Cboe Volatility Index
        (VIX) futures and forthcoming products like Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance
        (VA) futures and Cboe S&amp;P 500 Dispersion Index (DSPX) futures.</p>

        ><![CDATA[<p>South Africa’s Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA)
        has imposed a 10-year ban on Kabelo Emanuel Mogale and fined him
        R1,015,315.87 ($54,827) for providing unlicensed financial signals in
        the forex market.</p> <p>An <a
        href="https://financefeeds.com/trive-south-africa-taps-finaltos-fsca-approved-odp-liquidity-solution/"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">FSCA</a> investigation revealed that
        Mogale was operating under the alias “Forex Private Jet Injectors,”
        offering unauthorized financial advice and forex signals via Telegram.
        The FSCA stated that these actions breached the Financial Advisory and
        Intermediary Services Act (FAIS Act), which mandates that individuals
        offering financial services must hold a valid license.</p> <p>The
        regulator determined that Mogale’s forex signals and trading tips
        qualified as providing financial services. Additionally, the
        investigation found that Mogale failed to cooperate with authorities,
        further violating section 139(2) of the Financial Sector Regulation Act
        No. 9 of 2017.</p> <p>Providing financial signals without proper
        licensing is illegal under South African law, and those engaging in such
        activities face criminal penalties. The FSCA emphasized that signal
        providers who charge fees or take a share of profits must be licensed to
        operate legally within the financial services sector.</p> <p>Investors
        are urged to verify the licensing status of any financial service
        provider, particularly in the online trading and forex markets, to avoid
        falling victim to unlicensed operators. The FSCA continues to oversee
        and regulate forex brokers in South Africa, ensuring that platforms
        operating within the country comply with local regulations.</p> <p>In a
        broader effort to enforce compliance, the FSCA recently warned against
        14 unlicensed Financial Service Providers (FSPs) offering derivative
        trading options. This warning, issued on March 28, 2024, highlighted the
        risks associated with unregulated financial activities and reinforced
        the need for investor vigilance.</p> ]]></content:encoded

        <p><b>Conclusions</b></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The
        Financial Commission witnessed a continued slowdown in new complaints
        from traders amid the summer slowdown and decreased trader activity.
        Specifically, the organization experienced an 8% drop in new complaints
        filed, while the total number of complaints resolved in the quarter fell
        by 7%. At the same time, total complaints amounts sought and awarded and
        average complaint values all fell by 43%, 36%, and 40% respectively. In
        complaint categories, financial-related complaints continued to dominate
        for 3Q 2024. Complaints valued at $500-$999 also jumped 5% during this
        period, while HNW complaints valued at above $10K grew by
        20%. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the period,
        the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) resolved complaints slower than
        in previous quarters, with 6.6 days in average dispute resolution
        time.</span></p> <p><b>About Financial Commission</b></p> <p><span
        style="font-weight: 400;">The Financial Commission is an independent
        external dispute resolution (EDR) organization for consumers/traders who
        are unable to resolve disputes directly with their financial services
        providers who are members of the Financial Commission. The Financial
        Commission initially set out to provide a new approach for traders and
        brokers alike to resolve any issues that arise in the course of trading
        electronic markets such as Foreign Exchange, and then expanded into CFDs
        and related derivatives, in addition to certifying technology platforms
        used for trading.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more
