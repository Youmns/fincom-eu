        Markets&#8217; ongoing commitment to Web3 innovation, providing direct

        frameworks, and digital wallet technology—all crucial elements in
        developing cutting-edge financial products.</p> <p><a
        href="https://financefeeds.com/cmc-markets-acquires-33-stake-in-uk-blockchain-firm-strikex/"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMC initially invested in StrikeX in
        2023</a>, viewing the 33% stake as a strategic move into tokenised
        finance and self-custody solutions. With majority ownership now secured,
        StrikeX formally integrates into the CMC Markets group, accelerating
        product development, facilitating regulatory approvals, and enabling
        broader international expansion.</p> <p>As part of the agreement, CMC
        Markets has also increased its holdings of StrikeX’s native STRX tokens
        from 10 million to 15 million, further solidifying its commitment to the
        StrikeX ecosystem.</p> <p>“This majority acquisition represents a
        significant leap forward in our ambition to lead in digital assets,”
        said Lord Peter Cruddas, CMC’s founder and CEO. “We are building a
        future-ready platform to deliver regulated, institutional-grade access
        to tokenised assets and blockchain-powered solutions.”</p> <p>StrikeX
        CEO Joe Jowett has previously highlighted the partnership as a
        pioneering effort to bring conventional financial instruments—such as
        equities, bonds, and commodities—to blockchain technology.</p>
        <p>StrikeX, a burgeoning blockchain enterprise based in London, is
        dedicated to creating accessible tools that integrate traditional
        financial assets onto blockchain platforms compliantly. Notably, it
        developed TradeStrike, an intuitive wallet and trading platform tailored
        specifically for Web3 applications.</p> <p><a

        target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CMC Markets</a>’ enhanced
        involvement with StrikeX reflects a broader industry trend of
        traditional financial institutions increasingly adopting blockchain and
        tokenisation technologies.</p> <p>Earlier this year, in January, <a
        href="https://financefeeds.com/cmc-markets-stock-tumbles-despite-50-revenue-boost/"
        target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CMC Markets</a> reassured

        annual net operating income targets. Additionally, the firm reaffirmed
        its anticipated costs guidance at approximately £225 million, excluding
        variable remuneration and one-off charges.</p> <p>CMC Markets has
        scheduled the publication of its full financial results for fiscal year
        2025 on June 5, 2025. Despite market anticipation of an upward revision,
        the firm maintained its previous financial projections, aligning closely
        with market forecasts.</p> ]]></content:encoded

        data-end="985">The opposition centers around compensation awarded to CEO
        David Zruia and CFO Elad Even-Chen, who each received nearly $5 million
        in pay packages last year, up from $3.7 million previously, despite a
        mixed performance across recent quarters.</p> <p class=""
        data-start="987" data-end="1220">The AGM also revealed that 22% of
        shareholders voted against reappointing Steve Baldwin as a non-executive
        director. While the motion passed, the level of dissent underscores
        ongoing dissatisfaction with the company’s governance.</p> <p class=""
        data-start="1222" data-end="1508">Despite these concerns, Plus500 raised
        its 2025 outlook, even as its Q1 results painted a complex picture.
        Revenue increased 13% quarter-on-quarter but declined 5% year-on-year.
        EBITDA climbed 23% over the previous quarter, though it was still 9%
        lower than the same period in 2024.</p> <p class="" data-start="1510"
        data-end="1782">Customer engagement metrics revealed further challenges.
        The platform attracted 26,897 new users in Q1, a decline from over
        36,000 in Q4 2024. Active users also fell 4% to 130,514. However,
        average deposit per user surged to $12,450, more than double the prior
        figure.</p> <p class="" data-start="1784" data-end="2126">In response to
        the shareholder vote, the Plus500 board stated it is taking the feedback
        seriously and plans to continue engaging with stakeholders to improve
        corporate governance and executive pay practices. The board emphasized
        that shareholder input will shape future decisions and acknowledged the
        company’s unique operating structure.</p> <p class="" data-start="2128"
        data-end="2374">In early 2025, Plus500 became a clearing member of ICE
        Clear US, aiming to reduce trading costs and expand services. The
        company also secured a UAE regulatory license, enabling it to offer
        futures and stock trading products in the region.</p> <p class=""
        data-start="2376" data-end="2640">Plus500 reported record growth in its
        B2B and retail futures trading segments, driven by its flagship product,
        Plus500 Futures. The company further expanded by entering the Japanese
        market with a localized trading platform tailored to retail
        investors.</p> <p class="" data-start="2642" data-end="2956">Meanwhile,
        the broker continues to strengthen its regulatory footprint. It received
        a license from the Securities Commission of the Bahamas in July 2023 and
        has since reported promising growth in the Middle East, particularly
        after obtaining approval from the Dubai Financial Services
