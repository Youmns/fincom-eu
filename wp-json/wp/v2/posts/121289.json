Increases across the board in new filed and resolved complaints amounts sought and awarded to traders, as well as average complaint values, suggest more traders are taking on substantial risks in their trading sizes as they try and take advantage of market opportunities. Roughly 32% of all new complaints filed with the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) in May were valued between $1,000-$10K+, highlighting the continued importance of the organization to investigate complaints with a significant monetary value. During the month, the DRC was able to resolve 15% more cases than in April, with average resolution times rising by 29% to a still manageable 7.2 days.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Founded in 2013, the Financial Commission is a leading independent member-driven external dispute resolution (EDR) organization for international online brokerages, exchanges and Blockchain firms that participate in global foreign exchange (forex), derivatives, CFD and digital asset markets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Financial Commission provides efficient compliance solutions to its members, alongside its External Dispute Resolution (EDR) mechanism that serves as an effective channel for processing complaints from clients of member firms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information please contact us at <\/span><a href=\"mailto:info@financialcommission.org\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">info@financialcommission.org<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>June 9th 2021, The Financial Commission today announces significant increases in key metrics, including new complaints filed, amounts sought and awarded in May 2021 as part of its monthly Complaints Digest.
