MIFIR Transaction Reporting<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">MiFIR transaction reporting requires the details of qualifying transactions to be reported to a National Competent Authority (\u201c<strong>NCA<\/strong>\u201d) or Approved Reporting Mechanism (\u201c<strong>ARM<\/strong>\u201d) within one day (T+1) of the transaction. It applies to transactions in financial instruments that are:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>admitted to trading or traded on a trading venue;<\/li>\n<li>whose underlying is a financial instrument admitted to trading or traded on a trading venue; or<\/li>\n<li>is an index of a basket comprised of such financial instruments,<\/li>\n<li>regardless of whether these transactions are traded outside the trading venue.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Transaction reports are required to include the identity of both the client and the trader or algorithm responsible for the investment decision and\/or execution. Keep an eye out for a separate article which we will release shortly, explaining the requirements for executing agents.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Who has to report?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Investment Firms as defined in <a href=\"http:\/\/kellian.webplus.net\/MIFID2\/Article4-Definitions.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Article 4(1)(1) of MiFID II <\/a>\u00a0and EEA branches of third country Investment Firms.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2. MiFID Commodity\u00a0Position Reporting<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Commodity derivatives listed on EEA trading venues (a Regulated Market (\u201c<strong>RM<\/strong>\u201d), Multilateral Trading Facility (\u201c<strong>MTF<\/strong>\u201d) or Organised Trading Facility (\u201c<strong>OTF<\/strong>\u201d)) and OTC derivative contracts that are deemed to be \u2018economically equivalent\u2019 to the venue listed instruments.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Who has to report?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">MiFID Investment Firms and EEA branches of third country Investment Firms who trade the relevant commodity derivatives.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3. EMIR Reporting<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">EMIR includes an obligation to report details of all derivatives to trade repositories.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Who has to report?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All counterparties to derivative transactions including both financial and non-financial counterparties but not natural persons.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4. MIFIR Trade Publication<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also referred to as \u2018trade reporting\u2019, trade publication relates to the near real-time public dissemination of trade data through an Approved Publication Arrangement (\u201c<strong>APA<\/strong>\u201d) required for transactions in in EEA venue-listed instruments. These reports don\u2019t require as much information as a transaction report \u2013 the focus is on execution data relating to volume and price \u2013 and only one report is required for the trade rather than by all firms involved in the transaction as with transaction reporting.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Who has to report?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Either the trading venue or where a venue isn\u2019t involved then the publication requirement falls to the Systematic Internaliser (\u201cSI\u201d). SIs are investment firms which on an organised, frequent, systematic and substantial basis, deal on their own account when executing client orders outside a regulated market (\u201c<strong>RM<\/strong>\u201d), multilateral trading facility (\u201c<strong>MTF<\/strong>\u201d) or organised trading facility (\u201c<strong>OTF<\/strong>\u201d) (together, \u201c<strong>Trading Venues<\/strong>\u201d) without operating a multilateral system.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If no SI is involved in the transaction then the obligation falls upon an Investment Firm.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5. MiFIR Reference Data Reporting<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">MiFIR requires the submission of instrument reference data from certain firms. This will enable regulators to compile a list (ESMA\u2019s Financial Instrument Reference Data System or \u2018FIRDS\u2019) of instruments that are traded on venue or by a SI.\u00a0 Keep an eye out for our upcoming article with further information on SIs.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><em>Who has to report?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The reporting of reference data is an obligation that falls upon firms operating trading venues and firms acting as a SI.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/0002.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-38607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/0002.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/0002.png 380w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/0002-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/elementor\/thumbs\/0002-q51z8eultb4ghwtlunvjokyyrenvxek8e0bzt2tlcs.png 150w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/0002-180x180.png 180w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/0002-230x230.png 230w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/0002-350x350.png 350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Quinn Perrott<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Quinn has an extensive background in IT starting as the IT Manager for City Index.
