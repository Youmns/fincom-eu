The Financial Commission also has confidence that the members of the Dispute Resolution Committee will be able to resolve any complaints in a manner that is fair for both the trader and the broker.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Financial Commission feels that a well-functioning alternative dispute resolution process in the Forex industry will encourage traders to seek solutions to the problems they encounter when trading the Forex market. This will help both the trader and the broker save time and resources which can be better spent elsewhere. In addition, an efficient alternative dispute resolution process will help boost trader confidence in their broker as well as the Forex industry. The Financial Commission is open for membership to brokers across the world and plans to hear disputes from traders of all monetary value.<\/p>\n<p>The Financial Commission features a Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) comprised of senior members in the Forex industry. The DRC members include Carl Elsammak, CEO Kammas Trading; Ilan Azbel, CEO Autochartist; Francesc Riverola, Founder FXStreet and Ilya Sorokin, CEO Act Forex. The DRC members bring diverse backgrounds, strong legal skills and extensive experience to the role. This experience will enable the DRC to review and resolve disputes providing both the broker and trader an amicable solution to any issues that arise in the course of Forex trading.<\/p>\n<p>As of now, the Financial Commission is finalizing the final details of the rules and the organization setup with both its members and Dispute Resolution Committee.
