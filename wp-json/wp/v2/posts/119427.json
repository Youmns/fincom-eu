The continued interest in trading has supported the demand for dispute resolution services, as highlighted by several key metrics of the Financial Commission, including new complaints filed, average complaints values and total compensation sought by traders. While financial-related complaints continued to dominate, trading complaints jumped 27% in January, suggesting investors are having more issues with regards to trade executions and pricing than at the tail end of 2020. At the same time, the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) was able to once again rule a significantly higher number of complaints in favour of trades in January, as cases ruled in favour of clients jumped 190% month-over-month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Founded in 2013, the Financial Commission is a leading independent member-driven external dispute resolution (EDR) organization for international online brokerages, exchanges and Blockchain firms that participate in global foreign exchange (forex), derivatives, CFD and digital asset markets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Financial Commission provides efficient compliance solutions to its members, alongside its External Dispute Resolution (EDR) mechanism that serves as an effective channel for processing complaints from clients of member firms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information please contact us at <\/span><a href=\"mailto:info@financialcommission.org\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">info@financialcommission.org<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>February 15th\u00a0 2021, The Financial Commission announces continued monthly growth in submitted complaints, as well as compensation sought and awarded to traders for January 2021 as part of its monthly Complaints Digest.
