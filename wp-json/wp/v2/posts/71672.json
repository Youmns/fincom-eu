The case does not fall under the last condition of paragraph 10.1 of the \u201cTerms of Business\u201d referred to by the Company. According to the paragraph 10.1 of the \u201cTerms of Business\u201d non-market quotes or spike is an error quote with the following characteristics:<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #000080;\">a) a significant price gap;<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #000080;\">b) a price rebound in a short time period within a price gap;<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #000080;\">c) no prior rapid price fluctuation before the spike;<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #000080;\">d) no released macroeconomic indicators and\/or corporate reports that could influence the price.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #000080;\">2. In client\u2019s opinion an example of non-market quotes\u00a0provided by\u00a0the Company\u2019s on its website has nothing to do with the EURRUB quotes in the reporting period.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #000080;\">3. The client has provided a screenshots of the tick charts on EURRUB currency pair of other companies where such high-volatility quotes were registered.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #000080;\">Consequently, the client demands restoration of the trading history by the time of market closing on the 7th of November 2014 or monetary reimbursement in the amount of 4742.62 USD without restoration of the trading history.<\/p>\n<table style=\"width: 896px;\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 490px;\" colspan=\"2\">Complainant<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 393.99px;\" colspan=\"3\">Broker<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 490px;\" colspan=\"2\">XXX<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 393.99px;\" colspan=\"3\">YYY<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 490px;\" colspan=\"2\">Financial Commission Complaint<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 393.99px;\" colspan=\"3\">#ZZZ<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 490px;\" colspan=\"2\">Complaint Raising Date<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 393.99px;\" colspan=\"3\">Complaint Filing Date<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 490px;\" colspan=\"2\">15\/11\/2014<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 393.99px;\" colspan=\"3\">1\/12\/2014<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 884px;\" colspan=\"5\"><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 884px;\" colspan=\"5\">Complaint Response:<\/p>\n<p>The decision for this complaint is based on the information provided by Mr. XXX and Broker YYY and\u00a0the analysis of the market situation of the EURRUB instrument in the given time period.<\/p>\n<p>1)\u00a0In the reported period Russian Ruble was very unstable, the market experienced increased volatility and low liquidity. In such cases any news or activities of the Central Bank or any other large participant of the market may lead to\u00a0big price fluctuations;<\/p>\n<p>2)\u00a0The client did not change his trading strategy during the reported period and did not try to deceive the Company. According to the Company\u2019s report it could be seen that the client has never shown an aggressive trading behavior and also, that the client has never changed his trading strategy in the similar conditions;<\/p>\n<p>3)\u00a0The Company should not change the trading conditions retroactively and should consider possible rate fluctuations of the RUB instruments. Closing of the profitable transactions in non-liquid time cannot be regarded as a reason to refuse client in a payment;<\/p>\n<p>4)\u00a0The Company has enough\u00a0tools to limit its risks when trading during the hours of low liquidity, especially for instruments that are generally low liquid.
