Continued interest in trading has supported the demand for dispute resolution services, as highlighted by several key metrics of the Financial Commission, including new complaints filed and total complaints resolved, average complaints values, and non-member compensation sought. While financial-related complaints continued to dominate, non-trading complaints jumped 39%, suggesting investors are having issues outside of traditional trading and funding or withdrawals. At the same time, the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) was able to rule a significantly higher number of complaints in favor of traders in December, as cases ruled in favor of clients jumped 100% month-over-month.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Founded in 2013, the Financial Commission is a leading independent member-driven external dispute resolution (EDR) organization for international online brokerages, exchanges, and Blockchain firms that participate in global foreign exchange (forex), derivatives, CFD, and digital asset markets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Financial Commission provides efficient compliance solutions to its members, alongside its External Dispute Resolution (EDR) mechanism that serves as an effective channel for processing complaints from clients of member firms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information please contact us at <\/span><a href=\"mailto:info@financialcommission.com.co\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">info@financialcommission.com.co<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>January 12th, 2021, The Financial Commission announces continued growth in submitted and resolved complaints, as well as compensation awarded to traders for December 2020 as part of its monthly Complaints Digest.
