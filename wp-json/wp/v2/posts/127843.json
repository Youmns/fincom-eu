Renewed growth in filed and resolved complaints, as well as compensation sought suggest traders may be taking advantage of price volatility on traditional markets in light of the negative impact to such asset classes as digital currencies. In 3Q 2022 the organization also experienced growth of all amounts sought metrics, including total amounts sought and those only attributed to members and non-members. There was a significant change in the complaints topics for the period, with financial complaints rising 54% and non-trading complaints falling by 13% of all new complaints for the period. Complaints listed in the value category $1-10K jumped 25%, highlighting the continued importance of the organization to investigate complaints with higher monetary values. During the quarter, the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) accumulated more complaint investigations carrying over into 4Q 2022 due to the complex nature of the dispute subjects, while nonetheless improving already exceptional average resolution times, which still continue to outpace alternative EDR services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Financial Commission has conducted dispute resolution services specifically for FX and CFD traders and broker member firms since 2013 as an independent, non-governmental self-regulatory organization and external dispute resolution (EDR) forum.
