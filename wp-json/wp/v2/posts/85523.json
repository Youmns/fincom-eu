At the time of the incident, between 00:10:03 and 00:13:21 (server time) the client opened several positions on the currency pair GBPCHF (12 positions at 4,000 rubles in size and 1 position at 5,100 rubles in size). Further, according to the client, the trading platform experienced a technical issue, during which the price charts for GBPCHF stopped moving on the trading platform, after which a message appeared \u201ctrading in GBPCHF has been stopped due to technical reasons\u201d. As a result, all 13 open positions were closed by the broker and resulted in a material loss. It is the client\u2019s opinion that the prices displayed for GBPCHF on the trading platform at the time of the incident were \u201coff-market\u201d rates that significantly differ from the prices available at other trade execution venues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #003366;\">Considering the above, the client has asked the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) of the Financial Commission to check the validity of the trade executions on the client\u2019s account and is demanding a compensation from their broker in the amount of 84,960 rubles (account balance of 53,100 rubles + unrealized profit in the amount of 31,860 rubles), which were lost as a result of the executed trades on the broker\u2019s platform. The client provided documentary evidence to the DRC in the form of written communications with the broker, screenshots of their trading platform during the technical malfunction, historical rates for GBPCHF pair taken from the trading platform of <a style=\"color: #003366;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.finam.ru\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">finam.ru<\/a>, as well as screenshots of GBPCHF price charts taken from the website <a style=\"color: #003366;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.investing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">investing.com<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #003366;\">For its part, the Broker decided that it would be a fair decision in this particular case to cancel all the trades conducted by the client on the trading platform on March 14th, 2018. As such, all trade results were annulled by the Broker.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #003366;\">In studying the facts of the case the DRC determined this to be a \u201ctrade-related dispute\u201d. Trade disputes are related directly to the process of trading on the markets and include the execution of orders, margin requirement calculations, commission and trade cost calculations, trade liquidations and other situations directly related to placing trades on the Forex, CFD, and Binary Options markets. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #003366;\">As such, the Committee conducted a thorough review of the client\u2019s trades, the execution prices and the prices available at other independent execution venues. As a result, the DRC found that the broker unnecessarily annulled the results of all trades and determined which specific trades were executed under normal market conditions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #003366;\">It is with this determination that the DRC ruled partially in the customer\u2019s favor &#8211; to restore the P\/L from transactions that executed in normal market conditions.<\/span><\/p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Complainant<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Broker<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">XXX<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">YYY<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Financial Commission Complaint<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">#ZZZ<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Complaint Raising Date<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Complaint Filing Date<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">14\/03\/2018<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">22\/03\/2018<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\"><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\"><strong>Complaint response:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The decision for this complaint is based on the information provided by the Client and the Broker.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To ensure an objective investigation of the incident, the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) of the Financial Commission closely examined the documentary evidence provided by the parties to the dispute. Having analyzed the materials of the complaint, the Dispute Resolution Committee has come to the following conclusions:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The disputed transactions on GBPCHF were analyzed by the DRC to ensure that trades were executed at real market prices. To conduct this unbiased analysis the DRC received historical price data from several independent execution venues.
