Brokers can create, upload, and monitor watchlists in the community and receive real-time alerts on potential threats, such as chargebacks.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The DisputeWatch registry allows brokers to create and monitor watchlists for possible fraudulent activity in real-time while protecting their clients\u2019 information. When a broker joins DisputeWatch or adds new clients, the community-driven service lets the broker search the Community Registry to see if a client has any matched dispute records.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Benefits for Brokers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/dw.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85333 size-600\" src=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/dw-600x340.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"340\" srcset=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/dw-600x340.png 600w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/dw-300x170.png 300w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/dw-768x436.png 768w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/dw-200x113.png 200w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/dw-400x227.png 400w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/dw-800x454.png 800w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/dw.png 809w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Using the data provided by the community, DisputeWatch constantly monitors the watchlist for potential financial threats to the company and sends a notification whenever new disputes are found from people on your watchlist. It then automatically provides a visual match to help the broker see how much of the client\u2019s information matches the information in the Community Registry. This information allows brokers to stop fraudulent transactions and disputes before they happen.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Value-Added Services<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">DisputeWatch is currently an invite only community. Financial Commission broker members can receive access to DisputeWatch at no charge as part of their membership*.

Access to the DisputeWatch community is not guaranteed and can be terminated without prior notice at the discretion of DisputeWatch.
