The amount of compensations awarded increased exponentially to $1,564,700.00 in 2017, a nearly tenfold rise compared Year-over-Year (YoY) from $157,326 in 2016.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From the creation of new business segments to the expansion of its management and staff, and new approved members and improved complaints processing statistics for 2017, Financial Commission continues to prove its ability to scale and the vital role it has supporting international market participants. Accordingly, Financial Commissions is one of the fastest-growing and most recognized independent SRO and EDR body in the global retail Forex industry.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Financial Commission experienced greater interest from the broader trading community in assisting with disputes, as the number of complaints registered against non-member brokers rose to 135 in 2017, up more than triple on the year-over-year basis compared to 37 filed in 2016. A record 764 complaints sought over $5.77m in complaints.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even as the number of filed complaints increased by nearly 500% rising to 764 for the calendar year (or more than 63 per month on average) Financial Commission demonstrated that its EDR system is highly efficient as the speed of resolving the average complaint improved by 7% compared to 2016. Likewise, the ratio of resolved complaints improved by 15% in 2017, reflecting the increased efficiency of Financial Commission\u2019s dispute resolution process.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Further to Financial Commission\u2019s core growth as an independent for-profit business, there were significant cross-border synergies with national regulatory bodies including ARFIN in Belarus during 2017, and Russia\u2019s State DUMA shortly after the conclusion of the calendar year where Chairman Peter Tatarnikov consulted the Financial Markets Committee, advising on forex and derivatives trading.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/round-table-3.jpg\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-400 wp-image-64648\" src=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/round-table-3-400x267.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/round-table-3-400x267.jpg 400w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/round-table-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/round-table-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/round-table-3.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/round-table-3-200x133.jpg 200w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/round-table-3-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/round-table-3-800x534.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/a><\/td>\n<td style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/round-table-2.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-400 wp-image-64639\" src=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/round-table-2-400x266.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/round-table-2-400x266.jpg 400w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/round-table-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/round-table-2-768x511.jpg 768w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/round-table-2-830x552.jpg 830w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/round-table-2-230x153.jpg 230w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/round-table-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/round-table-2-480x319.jpg 480w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/round-table-2.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/round-table-2-200x133.jpg 200w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/round-table-2-600x399.jpg 600w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/round-table-2-800x532.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/a><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Financial Commission attended numerous events and participated as an exhibitor, and on panels at several key industry gatherings in 2017 across the globe, including in Europe and Asia, providing ample interaction with the public including gauging sentiment and hearing feedback..<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Major Industry Themes During 2017<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Following the importance of the <strong>Global FX Code<\/strong> highlighted in last year\u2019s annual report, there continued to be a rise of non-bank dealers in 2017 including prime brokers (PBs) and liquidity providers (LPs).

The Financial Commission continues to achieve this objective by providing brokerages and technology firms with the benefits that accompany membership status, as seen in the statistics results for 2017.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the number of new members added grew, there was a significant increase in the total number of complaints received in 2017 (764 complaints filed), compared Year-over-Year from 2016 (165 complaints filed). This nearly 500% increase was driven from the addition of new members reflecting the increasing credibility and positive reputation Financial Commission has been earning since its foundation and coupled with market volatility from major geopolitical events during the year.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The monetary amounts for complaints filed during 2017 ranged from as low as $7 to as much as $846,200.00, and the total amount of compensation that was paid out was $1,564,700.00 from a total of 764 complaints filed. The nearly five-fold increase in compensation sought highlights the increased monetary significance of the complaints processed by the DRC and broker client\u2019s reliance on the Commission in getting disputes resolved (as opposed to, in some cases, resorting to other regulatory bodies and legal channels including costly arbitration).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Overview of 2017 Complaints Statistics:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li><strong>Total Complaints filed 764 (100%)<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Complaints filed against Members 629 (77,58%)<\/li>\n<li>Complaints filed against non-Members 135 (22,42%)<\/li>\n<li>764 Complainants sought a record $5,773,857<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li><strong>Total amount of compensations $<\/strong><strong>1,564,700.00<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Maximum complaint amount awarded $846,200.00<\/li>\n<li>Minimum complaint amount\u00a0awarded $7.00<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Total amount of resolutions (against Members)<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Resolutions in favor of client 153 (24,32%)<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Resolutions in favor of broker 319 (50,72%)<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Out of jurisdiction 157 (24,96%)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-71851\" src=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart1-400x125.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"125\" srcset=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart1-400x125.png 400w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart1-300x93.png 300w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart1-700x220.png 700w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart1-200x62.png 200w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart1-600x187.png 600w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart1.png 706w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/a><\/td>\n<td>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-71860\" src=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart2-400x124.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"124\" srcset=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart2-400x124.png 400w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart2-300x93.png 300w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart2-700x218.png 700w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart2-200x62.png 200w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart2-600x186.png 600w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart2.png 704w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/a><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-71869\" src=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart3-400x130.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart3-400x130.png 400w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart3-300x97.png 300w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart3-700x229.png 700w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart3-200x65.png 200w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart3-600x194.png 600w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/chart3.png 707w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/a><\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Types of Complaints<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Trading complaints<\/strong> are directly related to the process of trading on the market and the effect of execution of orders, payment of margins, calculation of commissions, forced liquidation of positions and other parts of the trade cycle.

This new offering enables educational providers to voluntarily subject their educational materials for review by Financial Commission, when seeking to become a <a href=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/certification-services\/education-providers\/\">certified Education Provider<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2018 Outlook: Cryptocurrency Increasingly Adopted by Multi-Asset Forex Brokers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Following the reduction in leverage in 2017 that was anticipated in Financial Commission 2016 report, regulators have shifted to begin to issue guidance and restrictions about margin-based cryptocurrency CFDs, cryptocurrency exchanges trading the underlying, and announcements related to ICOs.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We expect these trends to continue to impact the online brokerage industry as fintech companies seek to raise capital via ICOs while implementing blockchain into their products and services, as well as see more brokerages continue to launch cryptocurrency CFDs, exchange-traded cryptocurrency products, and trading the underlying. Forex Brokers offering cryptocurrency CFDs faced challenges in 2017 with sourcing crypto liquidity and managing risks during high periods of market volatility causing leverage and trading to be reduced, comparable to the risk-management steps taken during Brexit-related market volatility during extreme times when leverage was reduced and trading suspended or put in close-only mode. We expect the industry to further mature in this regard as more crypto assets become listed as CFDs with more and more forex brokers that offer margin-based trading, as well as delivery of the underlying.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many self-regulatory trade associations are emerging to help meet the needs of the industry and may play an increasingly important role to guide policy for institutions and law makers, as new regulations are established to support the emerging blockchain economy in different parts of the world. Forex and CFD brokers continue to face the challenge of scaling their volumes amid a reduction in leverage and the demand for best execution. We expect regulatory arbitrage to become more pronounced then dissipate in a cyclical manner as new regulations are established in the wake of further innovations for public decentralized networks and for permissioned blockchain networks, as well as rules surrounding how related cryptographic assets are traded on secondary markets.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a rise in ICO marketing scams and unbalanced advertising has led to major bans on serving ICO-related ads on networks like FaceBook already in 2018, these trends highlight the growing need for best-practices to be established for marketers involved in ICOs and token sales. Financial Commission\u2019s Technology Certification service expanded to include Education Provider certification and ICO certification, to align with the growing needs of the Financial Technology and the Financial Services industry. We expect these segments to continue to evolve and mature as market conditions dictate.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For brokerages and technology providers operating in less stringent regulatory environments and jurisdictions where either no formal rules have been outlined, becoming a member of an independent SRO such as Financial Commission demonstrates a commitment to compliance, and helps win and maintain clients\u2019 trust.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With industry trends firmly in place, Financial Commission is positioned to sustain its growth through 2018, pending any major overhaul to global financial markets by the G20, for margin-based derivatives including forex, CFDs and cryptocurrencies, as well as trading the underlying in over-the-counter (OTC) and exchange-traded markets. Financial Commission\u2019s work with other private and national bodies, helps align our efforts strategically with emerging trends and needs of the broader community.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Online brokerages and technology providers who put their clients\u2019 interests first, join Financial Commission to provide customers a channel for dispute resolution, in the inevitable rare cases when disputes cannot be resolved internally.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With the arrival of cryptocurrencies, financial product complexity has risen to new heights, and client education has never been more important when it comes to understanding the evolving risks and potential of various investment products, including a broker\u2019s policies and procedures, product specifications, internal processes and controls \u2013 and other material information which affect customers and their contractual relationship with their broker.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Financial Commission continues to strive to educate clients, and brokers, and support related initiatives while holding brokers to high standards, and investigating each complaint that is filed through our EDR system by using a proven approach to the dispute resolution process.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Closing Remarks from Financial Commission Chairman<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>\u201cWe are delighted with Financial Commission\u2019s record achievements in 2017, and are continuing to carry that momentum into 2018. On the backdrop of highly dynamic conditions last year for financial markets and the financial services industry, Financial Commission experienced exponential growth in many of our core operating metrics. We experienced new milestones across the board last year including in membership, complaints processing, technology certification, education initiatives, as well as appointments to management, staff and committees, the creation of new business segments, and cross-border synergies with private and government organizations, all supporting our core mission. We thank all of our members and supporters dedicated to helping foster transparency with their commitment to our rules and use of Financial Commission\u2019s services, as we now enter our sixth year of operation. We continue to welcome new members and encourage new and existing brokerages and technology developers, whether regulated, unregulated, or self-regulated, to submit their membership application to Financial Commission, and review our requirements to see if your firm will qualify for approval. We\u2019ve also benefitted from industry feedback as we look to improve amid a changing landscape for financial markets globally with geopolitical tensions, rising interest rates, and the arrival of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. We look forward to continuing to roll out our new range of services to help the new and existing members, including technology certification services to non-members.
