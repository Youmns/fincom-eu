New global market price volatility and geopolitical uncertainty provided for a renewed interest in online trading, leading to a record amount of new complaints for the organization, as well as improved operational metrics.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organization further expanded its membership ranks with large, internationally recognized brokers, as well as new members in the Asia region. The organization\u2019s free dispute resolution service to traders gained popularity in Asia, Latin America and Europe with new complaints from these regions growing 47%, 38% and 30% respectively, while complaints from the Middle East grew moderately at 15% in 2022. The Financial Commission also saw a continued decrease of 38% in complaints from Russia and former Soviet republics, as local market restrictions remained in place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of complaints in 2022 were related to non-trading issues with 58% of the total, while financial related disputes accounted for 29% and trading related complaints 13%. The most popular topics for complaints dealt with account blocking (29%), funds withdrawal (19%), price check (14%), non-market quotes (7%) and stop-out orders (6%). Of all resolved complaints, 42% were resolved \u201cin favor of the broker\u201d and 16% resolved \u201cin favor of the client\u201d, while 52% were found to be outside the organization\u2019s jurisdiction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heading into 2023, the Financial Commission expects to see healthy global demand for trading and investing, particularly among younger traders, with fiscal and geopolitical risks impacting the prices of commodities, equities and digital assets through the year.\u00a0 In this regard the organization is prepared to handle a further growth in the number of new complaints from traders during the year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Financial Commission has conducted dispute resolution services specifically for FX and CFD traders and broker member firms since 2013 as an independent, non-governmental self-regulatory organization and external dispute resolution (EDR) forum.
