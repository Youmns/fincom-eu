As the number of approved membership applications increased during the year, so did the number of complaints that were filed with Financial Commission during 2016.<\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There was further expansion from new appointments to the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) and significant cross-border synergies with other regulatory and non-governmental organization (NGOs), as well as meetings with foreign regulators and industry event participation in Europe and Asia where key Industry themes were observed and collected from market participants\u2019 feedback.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>Key Industry Themes During 2016<\/b><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several key industry trends persisted during 2016 such as the importance of self-regulatory efforts in the field of best-execution practices as the FX Global Code initiative was underway and brought the subject of fair dealing practices further under the spotlight, and as a voluntary code of conduct was rolled-out for interbank dealers. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A global derivatives survey by IOSCO in 2016 coincided with a growing wave of reforms against binary options providers and helped to set in motion efforts to seek a clear framework for how margin FX and CFDs are offered across various jurisdictions. These efforts paralleled a reduction in leverage implemented by several regulators following the aftermath of major events including the UK\u2019s Brexit that caused unprecedented volatility in the GBP\/USD currency pair in 2016. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the shockwave from these 2016 events including Brexit and major geopolitical shifts from Trump\u2019s victory in the US election, global markets including foreign exchange functioned efficiently with many brokers taking prudent measures to prevent against market gaps by voluntary reducing leverage and limiting trading on a number of occasions, reflecting self-regulation at its finest.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>Financial Commission 2016 in Review<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the backdrop of challenging market conditions, Financial Commission was well positioned to handle a significant increase in the number of complaints together with the addition of new members, as factors such as trading volumes and volatility ranged from low to high surrounding major events throughout 2016 and which led to considerable changes in asset values for active and passive market participants. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether due to volatile market conditions or from the normal course of day-to-day operations, disputes may arise between customers and their broker from time-to-time. When such grievances cannot be amicably resolved, a formal complaint is filed with Financial Commission &#8211; where it is then examined using a systematic approach and is fully investigated before being reviewed by the DRC to render a non-bias decision. Using a proven dispute resolution process, Financial Commission achieved another record year across the board during 2016 including the following key highlights:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2016 Highlights<\/b><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were 165 complaints filed with Financial Commission, a nearly 80% increase compared to 93 complaints filed in 2015. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were 4 new <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">appointments made to bolster the Dispute Resolution Committee. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A total of eighteen new members were approved by Financial Commission which brought the total number of members to thirty-three, including certified technology providers. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial Commission participated in key industry events across the globe, meeting with clients and members at important industry conferences in Hong Kong and Cyprus, and held important meetings with industry regulatory bodies in Eastern Europe.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-34738\" src=\"https:\/\/xcv.financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/finCom_150.png\" alt=\"fincom_150\" width=\"120\" height=\"120\" \/><\/td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial Commission operates as an independent EDR using a membership-based structure and is not a governmental organization or sanctioned by any jurisdiction, and is domiciled in Hong Kong under FinaCom PLC. The ethos of our mission statement is transparency, swiftness, and education, which are the paramount drivers that uphold our operations. <\/span><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supporting self-regulatory efforts is just one of the benefits provided by the Financial Commission to its members who join voluntarily \u2013 yet must adhere to strict guidelines in order to maintain membership and demonstrate transparency, compliance, and integrity to their customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Financial Commission helps intermediate fair dealings by providing an unparalleled dispute resolution process between online brokerages and their end-customers, in the rare but inevitable cases of trade disputes that cannot be resolved. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The subject of each complaint can be as diverse as the underlying broker, product, or customer, yet all disputes share one thing in common which is to seek fair dealings regardless of the financial services products, providers, trading technologies, or pricing issues related to market participants\u2019 transactions, from the complaints that are filed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial Commission guarantees protection of the interests of both brokers and traders, thus is providing a fair and neutral platform to effectively resolve complaints. Financial Commission ensures that traders\u00a0and brokers\u00a0are getting their disputes resolved in an efficient,\u00a0unbiased, authentic, and a\u00a0quick manner and walk away with a\u00a0well-founded\u00a0answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Details of 2016 Results<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below the Commission presents further details of its Annual Report for 2016, which also provides statistics on the number of complaints handled and key metrics regarding processing and mediation results. The statistics information is insightful to our Members and their clients, the public, and for brokerages that are considering the benefits of obtaining membership with the Financial Commission and\/or are interested in learning about the organization\u2019s structure.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2016 Complaint Statistics in Review<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The need for transparency continues to grow. Building trust is crucial and using fair and neutral 3rd party dispute resolution \u2013 that Financial Commission provides \u2013 is an effective solution in cases where clients or brokers cannot resolve matters together and seek an independent channel and wish to avoid often complex legal or costly arbitration alternatives. The Financial Commission continues to achieve this objective by providing brokerages and technology firms with the benefits that accompany membership status, as seen in the statistics results for 2016.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A significant increase of 77% was achieved in the total number of complaints received in 2016 (165 complaints filed), compared Year-over-Year from 2015 (93 complaints filed). This nearly 80% increase was driven from the addition of new members reflecting the increasing credibility and positive reputation Financial Commission has been earning since its foundation, and coupled with market volatility from major geopolitical events during the year. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The monetary amounts for complaints filed during 2016 ranged from as low as $10 to as much as $57,199.00, and the total amount of compensation that was paid out was $157,326.00 from a total of 165 complaints filed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Overview of 2016 Complaints Statistics:<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b>Total Complaints filed 165 (100%)<\/b><\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complaints filed against Members 128 (77,58%)\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complaints filed against non-Members 37 (22,42%)\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">165 Complainants sought a record $1,813,275.00<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Total amount of compensations $<\/b><b>157,326.00<\/b><\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximum complaint amount awarded $<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">57,199.00<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minimum complaint amount\u00a0awarded $10.00<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Total amount of resolutions (against Members) <\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resolutions in favour of client 39 (30,47%)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resolutions in favour of broker <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">61 (47,66%)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Out of jurisdiction 28 (24,87%)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b> Types of Complaints<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><b>Trading complaints<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are directly related to the process of trading on the market and the affect of execution of orders, payment of margins, calculation of commissions, forced liquidation of positions and other parts of the trade cycle.

Magnates<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><b>2017 Outlook: Wave of Changes to FX and CFD Markets, and Trump Geopolitics<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a clear shift towards a further reduction in leverage that is gaining momentum in various jurisdictions. Furthermore, the marketing of Forex and CFD trading is becoming increasingly regulated to help counter the significant degree of misleading advertising that is still prevalent in the online brokerage industry \u2013 albeit mostly from unregulated firms including binary options providers or in regulated environments that lack marketing guidelines. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, the recent expulsion from the National Futures Association (NFA) \u2013 a membership-based self-regulatory organization (SRO) in the United States, of online FX and CFD broker FXCM, a Nasdaq-listed company, highlights another major challenge that is prevalent in the industry &#8211; brokers claiming to offer agency execution who are routing orders to a 3<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rd<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> party dealer where the agency broker has common ownership in that dealer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While draconian measures may be taken by various regulators to eradicate these challenges, it will also likely add a notable compliance burden to firms in terms of increased time and effort (manpower) that will be needed to adhere to stringent compliance requirements with regard to order routing, execution, risk-management, disclosure requirements, and other such costs that will lead to an increase in regulatory compliance expenses. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For brokerages operating in less stringent regulatory environments and jurisdictions where no such formal rules have been outlined, there will be even more difficult challenges ahead in distinguishing a genuine offering from firms purporting to be legitimate brokerages \u2013 yet who are not, increasing the need for acquiring regulatory licenses from a bona-fide regulatory hub, and becoming members of independent SROs, as a means to demonstrate a firm commitment to compliance and best practices to win and maintain clients\u2019 trust.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there remains uncertainty in how the Trump administration would go about repealing parts of the Dodd-Frank Act in terms of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a repeal would directly affect the global online brokerage industry. One school of thought holds that this could benefit brokerages that will be able to provide clients a greater degree of trading freedom while having less compliance burden.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another school of thought is that loosening regulations in the US could increase chances of unfair dealing where greater risk falls on the client and away from the broker. A repeal of Dodd-Frank could possibly spark a global race where regulators in Europe and Asia roll-back restrictions to avoid regulatory arbitrage where consumers and brokerages may seek more favorably conditions in the U.S. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As reiterated in Financial Commission\u2019s 2015 report and here again for 2016, online brokerages who put their clients\u2019 interests first, whether agency brokers, market-makers or those who operate a hybrid-model, as well as technology providers that develop trading platform, by joining the Financial Commission demonstrate a firm commitment to clients and help support customer education efforts where the foundation of trust is built on understanding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With financial product complexity on the rise, client education has never been more important when it comes to understanding the details of how an investment product works, including a broker\u2019s procedures, processes including their internal controls \u2013 which can all affect how products are handled and what is permitted. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial Commission continues to strive to educate clients, and brokers, and support related initiatives while holding brokers to high standard and investigating each case thoroughly using a proven approach to the dispute resolution process and in a new era of geopolitical uncertainties and market volatility as 2017 is underway. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2016 Annual Report Closing Remarks from Financial Commission Chairman<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe are delighted to share the results of another successful year marked by further growth in key areas of operations, as highlighted in our 2016 annual report. Thanks to the support from our members, staff, and the online forex and CFD industry at large, Financial Commission continues to deliver an essential service to market participants, and against the backdrop of challenging market conditions including a shifting regulatory landscape. <\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A promising new year is already underway with new members approved, additions made to our in-house staff, and strategic objectives outlined to help sustain our momentum from 2016 through the end of 2017 and forward.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the focus on best-execution practices and price discovery came under the spotlight from the Global FX Code initiative, this is an area that we have been working with for several years already, and are well-positioned to continue to support companies and customers to help resolve trade-related disputes to help ensure fair dealing is being upheld. <\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also commend other global initiatives underway such as the IOSCO survey surrounding derivatives that concluded in December 2016, regarding margin FX and OTC products, aimed to help increase awareness and enhance regulatory reforms and improve market integrity while best supporting companies and the customers they serve. <\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I stand behind what I voiced last year and reiterate that we welcome brokerages and technology providers, whether regulated, unregulated, or self-regulated, to submit their membership application to Financial Commission, and review our requirements to see if your firm will qualify for approval. Approved members show a firm commitment to their customer, by adding an extra level of support where Financial Commission will stand by both sides in cases where a complaint is brought, and with the aim to bring it to resolution quickly and fairly.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Peter Tatarnikov,<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Chairman,<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Financial Commission<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To learn more about the benefits and requirements of joining the Financial Commission, available for brokerages and technology providers, contact us and visit\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/xcv.financialcommission.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">www.financialcommission.org<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>February 15th, 2017:\u00a0New York &amp; Hong Kong: FinaCom PLC, operator of the Financial Commission (FinancialCommission.org) \u2013 an independent self-regulatory organization and external dispute resolution (EDR) body for the online trading industry including FX and CFD market participants, retail financial consumers, brokerages, and technology providers, today announces the results of its 2016 Annual Report. 2016 Membership [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"author":12,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[6401],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-71718","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-commission-reports"],"acf":[],"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"link","format":"url"}],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/71718","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/12"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=71718"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/71718\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":116078,"href":"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/71718\/revisions\/116078"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=71718"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=71718"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=71718"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
