The incident occurred on 29.04.2016 shortly before the end of the US trading session on Friday.

After a short period of time, the client&#8217;s position was closed by Stop Loss order with a slippage of several points.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #000080;\">The client does not agree with the actions of the Broker and believes that his position was closed at the non-market price. This follows from a comparison of USDJPY price graph in the platform of the Broker with the similar price graphs of other financial services providers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #000080;\">The client considers the actions of the Broker as unfair and requires:<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #000080;\">&#8211; to recover funds lost due to improper closing of the short position ($8469.69);<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #000080;\">&#8211; to compensate for unrealized gains on closed position in the amount of $26150.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #000080;\">For its part, the Broker believes that the Client&#8217;s complaint has no ground because his order was executed at real market prices. In support of his decision, the Broker provided the investigation with the server log records and the screenshot of the 1m chart of the instrument.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #000080;\">In addition to the above, the Broker refers to the paragraph XX.XX of the Terms of Business, according to which &#8220;The Trading Server of the Broker is the only reliable source of quotations, by which any relationship between both Sides arising from the Customer Agreement, the Terms of Business and other documents of the Company will be governed.&#8221;<\/p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Complainant<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Broker<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">XXX<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">YYY<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Financial Commission Complaint<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">#ZZZ<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Complaint Raising Date<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Complaint Filing Date<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">29\/04\/2016<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">7\/06\/2016<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\"><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\"><strong>Complaint Response: <span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">&#8230;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">The decision for this complaint is based on the information provided by Mr. XXX and Broker YYY.\u00a0<\/span>In order to investigate the incident and to make an objective decision on the complaint, the Dispute Resolution Committee of the Financial Commission closely examined the price dynamics of USDJPY in the period before and after the incident.After a comprehensive analysis of the market situation in the USDJPY instrument at the time of the incident, the Committee concluded that there were non-market prices in the quote feed of the Broker.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, the Committee considers that the transaction, which resulted in a Stop Loss order execution, should be canceled.
