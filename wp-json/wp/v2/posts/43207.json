We believe this subtle feature can easily help users prove whether a certificate is authentic and we encourage all members and those who received certification or membership certificates to use the new QR code stamped certificates immediately.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In order to check the validity of a certificate, users should scan the QR code or follow the link in order to be redirected to the company\u2019s profile on Financial Commission\u2019s website (a link to any other website would indicate a clone).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Certificates which do not have above-mentioned features should be regarded as fake.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This new validation layer adds an additional degree of security to Financial Commission\u2019s member certificates as well as for providers that have utilized the certification service for trading technology, education and ICO certification.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Financial Commission is an independent external dispute resolution (EDR) organization for market participants who are unable to resolve disputes directly with their financial services providers that are members of the Financial Commission.
