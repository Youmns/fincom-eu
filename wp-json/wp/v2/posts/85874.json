As a result, the aforementioned clone website has been successfully blocked and the Financial Commission filed a claim with the domain registrar to take ownership of the all-too-similar domain address to ensure that traders are always accessing official Financial Commission materials. Moreover, the Financial Commission takes all necessary actions, including reporting to law-enforcement authorities and initiation of legal proceedings against \u201ccatfish\u201d, \u00a0in order to protect and prevent all fraudulent activities against its clients in the future.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We remind the trading community that the Financial Commission services for traders are 100% free and our representatives will contact broker clients by phone or email only in response to an inbound inquiry received on our website and social media pages. The Financial Commission absolutely does not solicit payments or fees for its services from traders.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The great lengths that companies may go to help perpetrate a fraud can be difficult for even the most cautious investors to detect.
