The 12 providers account for around 84% market share, so the aggregate retail client losses across the industry for this single week may be higher.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/photo_2020-05-06_10-04-50.jpg\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-107441 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/photo_2020-05-06_10-04-50.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"585\" height=\"297\" srcset=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/photo_2020-05-06_10-04-50.jpg 780w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/photo_2020-05-06_10-04-50-300x152.jpg 300w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/photo_2020-05-06_10-04-50-768x390.jpg 768w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/photo_2020-05-06_10-04-50-200x102.jpg 200w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/photo_2020-05-06_10-04-50-400x203.jpg 400w, https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/photo_2020-05-06_10-04-50-600x305.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, many customers experienced negative balances in their accounts as a result of rapid price movements which led to the liquidation of trading positions with margin calls. In this respect, A total of 5,448 retail client accounts of the 12 providers in the sample (or 2% of their retail client accounts that traded during that week) went into negative balance to the value of over -$4 million in aggregate. That is, they lost their initial investment and owed a further $4 million to the CFD providers. Some of the providers absorbed the losses themselves. In addition, the regulator noted increases in the cost of holding oil contract CFDs overnight &#8211; the so-called \u201cswap\u201d or \u201crollover\u201d charge, which grew in some cases to 220% per annum.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We remind traders to always follow a sound risk-reward strategy and effectively use all the tools available to minimize risks.
