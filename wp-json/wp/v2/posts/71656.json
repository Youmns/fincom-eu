This type of\u00a0investment exposure includes certain unique characteristics with regards to time and other conditions,\u00a0as will be explained below.<\/p>\n<p>While the regulatory status with regards to binary options varies per jurisdiction, the space is growing\u00a0and evolving at a steady pace. The Financial Commission as part of its mission statement aims to provide\u00a0traders with educational content to help better their understanding of this type of trading instrument.\u00a0The next section will compare some differences within options.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Not all Options are Created Equal<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Buying options typically conveys the right \u2013 but not the obligation \u2013 to buy or sell an underlying asset at\u00a0a specified price, and which can be exercised within a certain duration of time (with key differences\u00a0between how American and European style options can be exercised) until the expiration date is\u00a0reached.<\/p>\n<p>Binary options share many similarities with traditional options, yet have many components that have\u00a0been removed from the equation by incorporating pre-determined criteria into the process to simplify\u00a0it.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore while trading stock options is often for more advanced traders and is more complex in nature,\u00a0Binary Options offer an easy way for the \u00a0beginner trader to learn about speculating in the financial\u00a0markets. At the same time there are still some key parallels with regards to options that every trader\u00a0should know, such as the time component as will be detailed next.<\/p>\n<p><strong>All Options Have an Expiration Date<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One common theme all options share is that they are a wasting asset. This means that they expire\u00a0worthless if not exercised (and if they are not in-the-money or passed their break-even point), and are\u00a0either cash-settled or deliver a multiplier of the underlying asset (i.e. 100 shares, etc&#8230;).<\/p>\n<p>In essence this time component means that the time value ticks away and degrades over time regardless\u00a0of market conditions, and therefore choosing the right amount of time (duration until expiry) is an\u00a0important element of timing an option trade correctly.<\/p>\n<p>For this reasons it\u2019s crucial to understand the particular options contract specification, and how your\u00a0broker processes any profits or break-even scenarios which may be either automatically paid out upon\u00a0or before expiration and\/or whether the contracts can be manually exercised before or at expiration.<\/p>\n<p>With binary options this entire process is typically very simple (when compared to trading stock options)\u00a0and can be clarified by your broker, but it\u2019s a good ideas to see it in writing &#8211; normally in the account\u00a0agreement or product listing under the contract\/instrument specifications so there is no uncertainty .<\/p>\n<p><strong>How are Binary Options Different?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Binary Options simplify the often complex dimensions of risk characteristics that traditional options\u00a0trading carries, by creating only two possible outcomes \u2013 either a profit or a loss \u2013 hence the dualistic\u00a0name \u201cBinary\u201d which has been appropriately designated to these option contracts (keep in mind that a\u00a0third outcome is possible in some cases if a trade reaches a break-even outcome and there is neither a\u00a0profit or loss.)<\/p>\n<p>This simplification enables traders of nearly all experience levels to understand the basics of binary\u00a0options trading without having to learn the complexities of traditional options investing which can\u00a0include premiums that change in value over time, time-value, and intrinsic and extrinsic value, as well as\u00a0the historical and implied volatility of the underlying asset, all factors that can directly affect the options\u00a0value over time.<\/p>\n<p>With Binary Options nearly all of those components are removed and the focus is entirely on the payoff\u00a0and break-even price since this will enable a trader to gauge how much to risk based on the trade size\u00a0and depending on their outlook of the underlying asset over time. Time is of course a key part as well,\u00a0and typically is chosen based on the outlook of the investors, with regards to their view on the\u00a0underlying assets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the Payoff?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With binary options the return component is typically called the \u201cpay-off\u201d where the value can be either\u00a0zero or positive, and both of which are known in advance. In essence the payoff is the result of the trade\u00a0and depends on whether the binary option trade becomes in-the-money by surpassing its break-even\u00a0price, and if not the cost of the investment is the loss generated on the trade.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, a trader who establishes a bullish trade or \u201ccall\u201d with a $50 payoff, can expect to make a $50\u00a0return if the price of the underlying asset increases over a specific rate &#8211; say for example $6.50 (for the\u00a0price of an underlying stock), within a fixed period of time (i.e. 60 seconds, 60 minutes, 1 week, etc..) .<\/p>\n<p>In such a scenario there are two main outcomes: either both the $6.50 price is surpassed and the trade\u00a0realizes a $50 profit on the $50 capital investment (100% return), or if the price is not reached &#8211; thus\u00a0there is a $50 loss (100% loss).<\/p>\n<p>However, in some cases (varies per broker) if the call price of $6.50 is reached exactly and doesn\u2019t\u00a0increase any tick higher from that break-even point, then the cost of the trade is returned (i.e. the\u00a0trader will receive his initial cost back and has a 0% gain or loss) where the trade is flat with a break-even return.<\/p>\n<p>Customer should fully understand the characteristics of binary options and the often unique features or\u00a0policies that their brokerage may have with regards to how orders are handled, and how positions and\u00a0options contracts function, including the various possible outcomes that can result from trading binary\u00a0options.<\/p>\n<p>The Financial Commission aims to provide educational content to traders, such as the information\u00a0above, to support a key part of our mission statement.
