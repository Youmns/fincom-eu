Cashback is automatically credited according to the schedule set by each broker and is guaranteed to be paid as STIC Cashback, not by the broker, settling the payment.<\/p>\n<p>By partnering with their chosen broker through STIC Cashback, customers benefit from STICPAY\u2019s lower transaction fees, cashback benefits, and exclusive promotions, which are not available when trading directly with the broker.<\/p>\n<p>New STIC Cashback customers signing up before July 31st can also receive a $10 bonus.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Over 20 FX\/CFD Brokers Partnered with STIC Cashback<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The new STIC Cashback service has teamed up with over 20 leading global brokers, including Exness, XM, FXGT, Justmarkets, FxPro, AvaTrade, and FinPros. This partnership offers traders a safe, streamlined, and reliable cashback service through membership in the STIC Cashback community.<\/p>\n<p>The launch of STIC Cashback coincides with the retail forex trading market&#8217;s strong growth, driven by the rise of smartphones and the development of emerging market middle classes. Global daily forex trading has reached approximately $7.5tn, with retail trading estimated to account for about 5.5% of that.<\/p>\n<p>Sean Park, STICPAY CEO, said: \u201cOur forex cashback service is a gamechanger for those customers seeking extra value and benefit from their everyday trades. By simply partnering with their chosen broker through STIC Cashback, they can unlock a world of benefits that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be accessible \u2013 and all though a safe, reliable and reputable platform.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>STICPAY Secures Labuan and Mauritius Licenses<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>STICPAY has recently acquired two new financial services licenses, enabling it to extend its services to clients in over 200 countries.<\/p>\n<p>In Malaysia, STICPAY has been granted a Labuan Financial Services Authority license and has been registered as a money brokering and payment system operator compliant with Labuan IBFC laws. This license allows STICPAY to provide services to developing markets across Southeast Asia.<\/p>\n<p>In Mauritius, STICPAY has been granted a Financial Services Commission (FSC) license and registered as a payment intermediary service. This license enables STICPAY to operate as an online Payment Service Provider (PSP) from Mauritius, accepting electronic payments through various methods, including credit cards, direct debit, bank transfer, and real-time transfers based on E-banking.<\/p>\n<p>With the addition of the Labuan and Mauritius licenses, STICPAY now operates with three licenses, having previously acquired a UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) license in 2019.
