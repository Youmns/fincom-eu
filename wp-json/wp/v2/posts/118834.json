The news portal reported that IG Group\u2019s South African entity has had trouble bringing CFDs onboard for client trading primarily due to the fact that South Africa\u2019s Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) does not regulate such financial products at the moment.<\/p>\n<p>IG Group\u2019s local entity is indeed licensed by the FSCA to provide execution only service, but it has not been able to receive any status to offer OTC derivatives &#8211; the category of CFDs.
