The DRC was able to award a smaller amount of compensation to traders than in the previous month while experiencing a significant jump in the amounts sought by traders from non-member brokers in December.\u00a0 Roughly 16% of new complaints filed with the DRC in December were valued between $1,000-$10K+, highlighting the continued importance of the organization to investigate complaints with a significant monetary value.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Financial Commission has conducted dispute resolution services specifically for FX and CFD traders and broker member firms since 2013 as an independent, non-governmental self-regulatory organization and external dispute resolution (EDR) forum.
