An increase in newly filed complaints and increases in resolved complaints suggest traders are continuing to try and take advantage of market opportunities with the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) continuing to process a significant amount of complaints in the first quarter of the year. The DRC was able to award a smaller amount of compensation to traders than in the previous quarter while experiencing a jump in the amounts sought by traders from broker members during this time.\u00a0 Financial-related complaints increased by 40%, which indicates a significant rise in disputes related to funds withdrawal. At the same time, complaints listed in the most valuable category ($10K+) jumped 70% in 1Q 2022, highlighting the continued importance of the organization to investigate complaints with a significant monetary value. During the quarter, the DRC was able to resolve 3% more complaints than in the previous period with fewer complaint investigations and decisions carried over into 2Q 2022, while maintaining exceptional average resolution times, which still continue to outpace alternative EDR services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Financial Commission has conducted dispute resolution services specifically for FX and CFD traders and broker member firms since 2013 as an independent, non-governmental self-regulatory organization and external dispute resolution (EDR) forum.
