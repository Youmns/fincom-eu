According to the Client, all trades performed on the specified trading account were opened either manually or by the means of EA, which is allowed by the Broker. The Client acknowledges that for the purpose of minimizing delay issues she used UK and US based VPS.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The incident on the Client\u2019s account occurred on March 1, 2022, i.e., on the day when the Broker reversed the Client\u2019s withdrawal request claiming that the Client\u2019s account was disabled for violation of trading rules established by the Company. The Client indicates that the Broker had blocked her account for no apparent reason, since in the Client\u2019s opinion, none of the Broker&#8217;s rules had been violated. According to the Client, the Broker let her withdraw only the initial deposit in the amount of 1400 USD and refused to pay the profits in the amount of 3657 USD, that, in the Client\u2019s opinion, were legally obtained in the period of trading on the Broker\u2019s platform.<\/p>\n<p>The Client does not agree with the Broker\u2019s decision (see below) and considers the actions of the Broker as unfair. According to the Client, she had been trading on the Broker\u2019s platform for several days using the same trading strategy without issues. In connection with the above, the Client requests the Dispute Resolution Committee of the Financial Commission to check the disputed transactions for alleged violations and requires the Broker to return the rest of the withheld funds. The Client provided the investigation with the Broker\u2019s comments on this complaint, as documentary evidence.<\/p>\n<p>In turn, the Broker claims that before the incident the Client had been using a combination of VPS and EA that are trying to abuse the system (exploit weaknesses in the Broker\u2019s trading platform). As such, the Broker does not see any grounds for the Client&#8217;s complaint and refers to clause 35.2 of their Client Agreement, according to which:<\/p>\n<p><em>35.2.

First, according to the Broker, prior to the incident the Client identified a technical problem on the Broker\u2019s side and implemented a strategy aimed at making risk-free profits at the expense of lagging \/ non-market prices. According to the Broker:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">a) The Client has been trading XAUUSD via high quality low latency VPS (IP address 89.31.124.153) which is located in the UK. The Broker allows using EAs and VPS, provided that combination of VPS and EA is not trying to abuse the Broker\u2019s MT4 infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">b) The Client\u2019s operations were probably driven by the means of EA. On the other hand, the Broker indicates that the EA driven trading activity is not verified by MT4, as the reason of all trades in the trading terminal history is \u2018Client\u2019 and not \u2018Expert\u2019. In the Broker\u2019s opinion \u201cthis is usually done (hidden) on EAs that are trying to abuse the system\u201d.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\u0441) Most of the Client\u2019s trades were opened and closed within minutes in volatile market conditions and most of them were counter positions with the same volume.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">d) Having compared their pricing with other major LPs like LMAX, the Broker is confident that in most cases the Client was getting better prices. The Broker believes that trading operations of this kind confirm the fact of the Client\u2019s deliberate trading using system vulnerabilities.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">e) The Client have been trading XAUUSD under 2 leg price arbitrage strategy by taking various and counter positions on 2 or more brokers and locking profit upon closing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">f) All trades performed on the Client\u2019s account were placed from 89.31.124.153. The Broker indicates that the VPS located on the specified IP address was used by one person for managing account # 599941130, as well as other clients\u2019 accounts, by the means of the exact same trading strategy. The history of investors\u2019 logins into trading account # 599941130 provided by the Broker confirms this fact.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Second, it should be noted that in order to make a decision on this case the DRC has analyzed the Client&#8217;s trading activity in the account # 599941130.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">a) Analysis of the nature of the transactions performed by the Client showed the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Client&#8217;s transactions were made in the period from 22.02.2022 to 01.03.2022;<\/li>\n<li>The 100% of the Client\u2019s transactions were made with one financial instrument (XAUUSD);<\/li>\n<li>The time of the disputed transactions\u2019 execution was within the period from 05:21 to 22:39 (server time, GMT);<\/li>\n<li>The duration of the Client&#8217;s transactions ranged from 2 minutes up to several hours, however roughly 35% of all transactions had their duration of 2-3 minutes;<\/li>\n<li>The most of transactions were performed during the hours of active market, however no correlation between the time of important news releases and the time of trades performed by the Client was found;<\/li>\n<li>All Client&#8217;s transactions were opened manually, without using EA, as confirmed by the server log provided by the Broker.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">b) The analysis of the financial results of transactions performed by the Client showed the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>After 89 transactions the Client received a net profit in the amount of 3657 USD;<\/li>\n<li>The share of Short positions established by the Client was 41.57% or 37 transactions;<\/li>\n<li>The share of Long positions established by the Client was 58.43% or 52 transactions;<\/li>\n<li>The share of profitable transactions performed by the Client was 51.69% or 46 transactions;<\/li>\n<li>The share of unprofitable transactions performed by the Client was 48.31% or 43 transactions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">3. Third, the DRC has verified the validity of the Broker&#8217;s assertion regarding the Client&#8217;s use of the vulnerabilities of their technical equipment and software for profit. For this purpose, the DRC has examined the documentary evidence provided by the Broker, as well as the history of price data on the financial instrument in the disputed transactions, obtained from independent providers of financial services. To ensure an objective investigation Financial Commission uses several different sources, such as Tradeproofer, Tradefora, Verify My Trade, TrueFX, FX Benchmark and some others for the purpose of verification of the quality of trades\u2019 execution. The analysis of execution quality of the Client&#8217;s trades showed that vast majority of them were opened and closed at actual prices available on the market.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">4. On the other hand, the experts of the DRC did not see any intelligible explanation why the Client&#8217;s actions violate any Trading Rules of the Broker:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">a) Experts did not see any problem with the client using a VPS, nor any problem with a client using an EA, nor any problem with the EA using &#8220;client&#8221; tag instead of &#8220;expert&#8221; tag;<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">b) Experts did not see any risk-free trading from the statement on the Client\u2019s account, since most of the Client\u2019s positions were opened and held for a long time without locking. The advantage in the opening or\/and the closing price can be leveled by the movement of the market. As such, trading risks were in place in this case.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\u0441) In the experts\u2019 opinion, price arb between brokers is a really smart way to trade. There is no problem with this since it is a very well accepted way of trading that is used by the highest level of professional traders at bank and hedge funds;<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">d) Also, the pricing of the product (XAUUSD) in the period of the incident was obviously very aggressive, but in the end that pricing was received from an LP and passed to the Client or generated by the Broker themselves. Scenarios like this have been seen before: where the LP skews its pricing according to its own exposure, which makes the prices much more aggressive and exposes the broker. This is not uncommon practice, but this is a problem that the broker needs to take care of with their LP, not with the trader.<\/p>\n<p>As such, in the common opinion of the DRC members, the Broker does not have sufficient grounds to assert that the disputed transactions performed on the Client\u2019s trading account # 599941130 were executed at lagging \/ non-market prices. It is unlikely that the Client might have used special technical means (EA) exploiting vulnerabilities in the Broker\u2019s quotation system.<\/p>\n<p>Based on the above, the members of the DRC of the Financial Commission have ruled in favor of the Client and decided the following:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Recognize the transactions disputed by the Broker as legitimate.<\/li>\n<li>Consider the cancellation of the financial results of this series of transactions by the Broker as unlawful.<\/li>\n<li>Hold the Broker liable for belated provision of the requested documentary evidence (statement, server log records).<\/li>\n<li>Hold the Broker liable for the provision of edited version of the statement, which makes it impossible to conduct a swift and thorough analysis of the Client\u2019s trading activity.<\/li>\n<li>According to the DRC\u2019s decision a compensation in the amount of 3657 USD should be paid to the Client.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Also, the experts of the DRC expressed their common opinion with regards to the organization of the sustainable operational process of the Broker&#8217;s infrastructure: DRC experts believe that if a Broker cannot provide a normal supply of prices, they should look for another source of information. Currently, there are many companies offering high-quality Market Data that can be used without any risk to business. According to the experts of the DRC, the Broker should take on the risks associated with the quality of the quotations supplied.<\/p>\n<p>This complaint was reviewed by the members of the Dispute Resolution Committee of the Financial Commission and was processed by the Head of the Committee.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Ruled in Favor<\/strong><\/td>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Compensation<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Client<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">3657 USD<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\">If you have any questions regarding this investigation, please send them to the following address info@financialcommission.org<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\"><strong>Acknowledgement<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\">I certify that all information was considered by the Dispute Resolution Committee of the Financial Commission and hereby confirm that the decision was made fairly, impartially and without interference.
