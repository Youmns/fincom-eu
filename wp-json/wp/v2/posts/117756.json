The increased trader activity in global markets, including equities and Contracts for Difference (CFD) had increased the demand for dispute resolution services, as highlighted by the improvements in several key metrics, including new complaints filed, amounts sought and amounts awarded. While financial-related complaints continued to dominate, trading related complaints experienced a 20% rise month over month, suggesting investors are back to finding trading opportunities following a summer lull. At the same time, the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) was able to rule a significantly higher number of complaints in favor of clients in October, as the month over month total jumped 90% to 42 complaints from 22 in September.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Founded in 2013, the Financial Commission is a leading independent member-driven external dispute resolution (EDR) organization for international online brokerages, exchanges, and Blockchain firms that participate in global foreign exchange (forex), derivatives, CFD, and digital asset markets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Financial Commission provides efficient compliance solutions to its members, alongside its External Dispute Resolution (EDR) mechanism that serves as an effective channel for processing complaints from clients of member firms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information please contact us at <\/span><a href=\"mailto:info@financialcommission.com.co\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">info@financialcommission.com.co<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>November 16th,\u00a0 2020, The Financial Commission announces a significant rise in its operating metrics for the month of October 2020 as part of its monthly Complaints Digest.
