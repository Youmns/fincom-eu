Specifically, the organization experienced a 3% slowdown QoQ in new complaints filed, as well as a 7% drop in the total number of complaints resolved in the quarter. Nonetheless, complaints amounts sought and awarded, as well average complaint values soared to significantly high levels. While some of the statistics were impacted by several large HNW complaints, the overall increases indicate that complaints submitted to The Financial Commission forum continue to grow in value this year and, evidently, so does the need for unbiased, independent and thorough investigation of such disputes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was also a noticeable increase in the complaints topics for the period, with increases in trading-related (6% QoQ) and financial-related (4%) complaints, which indicate that traders are continuing to find trading opportunities, even in possible narrow price ranges in FX and CFD markets.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the quarter, the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) managed to accumulate less complaint investigations carrying over into 2Q, although experiencing an uptick in\u00a0 average resolution times due to the complexity and duration of trading-related complaint investigations during this time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Financial Commission has conducted dispute resolution services specifically for FX and CFD traders and broker member firms since 2013 as an independent, non-governmental self-regulatory organization and external dispute resolution (EDR) forum.
