Thus slippage can occur even at the most technically sophisticated brokerages, and not a limitation in a providers system.<\/p>\n<p><b>Latency and Fast Markets<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The specific reason for slippage occurring is\u00a0 a time-delay between when an order is submitted and when an order is received, and to when an order is processed, even when this is done electronically \u2013 at the speed or light.<\/p>\n<p>The internet speed\/quality and geographic distances between servers, as well as the time needed by the servers to process such operations, all add to the potential latency that can cause rates to change, and thus cause a trade to be slipped either positively or negatively.<\/p>\n<p>In even a shorter period of time, a rate can have already changed a moment after it was displayed, making it no-longer executable or no-longer valid (and thus a stale price \u2013that would cause either slippage or a re-quote to occur).<\/p>\n<p>In the case of a broker only providing negative slippage and never providing positive, such practice is often frowned upon by regulators and described as Asymmetrical slippage.\u00a0 If slippage is to occur, it must be symmetrical, so the positive slippage should be passed on to customers- if the negative slippage is also passed on.<\/p>\n<p><b>Re-quotes Are Similar to Slippage, Except Trader Decides Whether to Accept or Not<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Similar to Slippage, a re-quote occurs when instead of slipping a trade, the broker presents the customer with the option to execute the trade at a different rate than the one they requested- \u00a0when in such cases the rates originally requested are no longer available.\u00a0 For example, if the EUR\/USD rate is Bid 1.3422 and Ask 1.3423, and a client submits a market order to buy at the ask price, the trading platform may re-quote the trade automatically at 1.3424 &#8211; if the rate has changed around the time the trader clicks submit\/enter to confirm the original order (submit it for execution).<\/p>\n<p>While the details of this process may vary across brokers and depend on their specific policies, the essence is the same in how the re-quoted rate may be more favorable or less-favorable (negative or positive) than the original rate requested.<\/p>\n<p>When dealing with complaints related to slippage or re-quotes, the Financial Commission will examine the rate logs, trade logs, tick-price history or other such data provided by the member broker in order to ascertain the degree of slippage if any and whether it was positive\/negative, as well as if the slippage was justified (comparing rate providers). Finally, slippage if and when it should occur, must be symmetrical for the sake of providing clients with fair dealing.<\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This article will help provide a simple explanation as to what the terms slippage and re-quotes refer to when dealing with online brokers, whether trading electronically or using a voice broker.
