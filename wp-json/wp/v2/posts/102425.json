Investors can look up the execution speed and quality of the trades they place in their brokerage account, as well as see how much actual costs they have incurred on each trade, including effective spreads, swaps, commission, and most importantly \u2013 hidden costs like slippage requires and rejects. Likewise, traders can compare their order execution prices with composite tick-by-tick data gathered from multiple sources with millisecond precision. This way traders can be more certain of their broker trading account performance and how it compares to the industry averages and get an accurate representation of the costs they have paid for trading.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.com.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Snimok-ekrana-2019-07-03-v-17.18.02.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-100321\" src=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.com.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Snimok-ekrana-2019-07-03-v-17.18.02-300x231.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"192\" srcset=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.com.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Snimok-ekrana-2019-07-03-v-17.18.02-300x231.png 300w, https:\/\/financialcommission.com.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Snimok-ekrana-2019-07-03-v-17.18.02-230x177.png 230w, https:\/\/financialcommission.com.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Snimok-ekrana-2019-07-03-v-17.18.02-350x269.png 350w, https:\/\/financialcommission.com.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Snimok-ekrana-2019-07-03-v-17.18.02-480x369.png 480w, https:\/\/financialcommission.com.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Snimok-ekrana-2019-07-03-v-17.18.02-200x154.png 200w, https:\/\/financialcommission.com.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Snimok-ekrana-2019-07-03-v-17.18.02-400x308.png 400w, https:\/\/financialcommission.com.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Snimok-ekrana-2019-07-03-v-17.18.02-600x462.png 600w, https:\/\/financialcommission.com.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Snimok-ekrana-2019-07-03-v-17.18.02.png 603w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Natallia Hunik &#8211; Global Head of Sales at Advanced Markets LLC commented on the partnership: &#8220;Advanced Markets is pleased to cooperate with Tradefora in this great mission of delivering crucial information on a broker\u2019s quality of execution, and execution venues, benefitting both traders and regulators alike.
