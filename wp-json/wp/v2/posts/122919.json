Increases in new filed and resolved complaints suggest traders are continuing to try and take advantage of market opportunities with the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) continuing to process a large number of complaints. The DRC was able to award a significantly larger amount of compensation to traders in August despite a lower total amount sought in all submitted complaints.\u00a0 At the same time, a little over 22% of all new complaints filed with the DRC in August were valued between $1,000-$10K+, highlighting the continued importance of the organization to investigate complaints with a significant monetary value. During the month, the DRC was able to resolve 55% more complaints than in July with additional operational resources, while the complexity of cases and communication times led to an uptick in average resolution times, which still continue to outpace alternative EDR services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Financial Commission has conducted dispute resolution services specifically for FX and CFD traders and broker member firms since 2013 as an independent, non-governmental self-regulatory organization and external dispute resolution (EDR) forum.
