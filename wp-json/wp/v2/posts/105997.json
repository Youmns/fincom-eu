It is obvious that it will not pass without a trace for the forex trading market since Citigroup is one of the largest dealers in this industry.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to the sources, Citi is seeking to cut the total number of supported platforms from 45 to 15 by the first quarter of 2020. \u201cWe just give our customers time to switch,\u201d it said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to the report, Brian McCappin, global head\u00a0of Citi FX institutional sales, added that Citi will conduct annual reviews of the forex platforms with which it works. New platforms will likely have to present a detailed business plan in order to connect to the system.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Such a decision results in savings from 5 to 10 million dollars a year. This is due to the fact that according to the results of the assessment, most platforms do not bring money.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Over the past ten years, multi-bank multi-user platforms have revolutionized foreign exchange trading. According to the Financial Times, at least two other major banks are considering using external systems.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Increased attention to trading platforms is likely to be directed to smaller systems that are already under pressure due to low volatility. Large platforms such as Reuters-owned FXall and the 360T Deutsche B\u00f6rse are likely to retain their place as the primary choice for banks.<\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In October last year, one of the world&#8217;s largest financial conglomerates, Citi, began testing the effectiveness of cooperation with Forex platforms.
