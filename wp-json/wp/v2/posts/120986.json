Increases in trading related complaints by 29% suggest more traders are taking advantage of market opportunities and having issues with trade execution or pricing. Roughly 26% of all new complaints filed with the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) in April were valued at $1,000-$10K, highlighting the continued importance of the organization to investigate complaints with a significant monetary value. During the month, the DRC was able to speed up the resolution of cases with average resolution times falling by 32% to just 5.6 days.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Founded in 2013, the Financial Commission is a leading independent member-driven external dispute resolution (EDR) organization for international online brokerages, exchanges and Blockchain firms that participate in global foreign exchange (forex), derivatives, CFD and digital asset markets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Financial Commission provides efficient compliance solutions to its members, alongside its External Dispute Resolution (EDR) mechanism that serves as an effective channel for processing complaints from clients of member firms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information please contact us at <\/span><a href=\"mailto:info@financialcommission.com.co\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">info@financialcommission.com.co<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>May 13th 2021, The Financial Commission today announces steady month over month figures for newly filed complaints, resolved complaints and other key metrics for April 2021 as part of its monthly Complaints Digest.
