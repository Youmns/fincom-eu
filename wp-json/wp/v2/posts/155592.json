Specifically, the organization experienced a 9% drop in new complaints filed, while the total number of complaints resolved in the quarter fell by 19%. At the same time, the total complaints amounts sought grew significantly (55%), as did the amount sought from member and non-member firms. The Commission awarded $110,481 to traders in the 4th quarter, representing a quarterly rise of 8%. Complaints valued at $100-$499 grew 8% during this period, while HNW complaints valued at above $10K grew 12%. Thus, average complaint values also experienced significant growth in the quarter with a 76% increase to $13,489.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>During the period, the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) resolved complaints 18% quicker than in the previous quarter, with 5.4 days in average dispute resolution time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span>The Financial Commission is an independent external dispute resolution (EDR) organization for consumers\/traders who are unable to resolve disputes directly with their financial services providers who are members of the Financial Commission.
