The company has announced <strong data-start=\"303\" data-end=\"324\">Robinhood Banking<\/strong>, a new online-only checking and savings service launching this fall exclusively for <strong data-start=\"409\" data-end=\"427\">Robinhood Gold<\/strong> members.<\/p>\n<p class data-start=\"438\" data-end=\"781\">The banking product offers a <strong data-start=\"467\" data-end=\"503\">4% annual percentage yield (APY)<\/strong> and <strong data-start=\"508\" data-end=\"545\">FDIC insurance up to $2.5 million<\/strong>. This coverage is made possible through a \u201cpass-through\u201d partnership with <strong data-start=\"620\" data-end=\"646\">Coastal Community Bank<\/strong>, an FDIC member. Although Robinhood isn\u2019t a licensed bank, the collaboration enables it to insure deposits on behalf of its customers.<\/p>\n<p class data-start=\"783\" data-end=\"1072\">Users will manage their accounts through a dedicated app that allows them to <strong data-start=\"860\" data-end=\"886\">send and receive money<\/strong>, and even <strong data-start=\"897\" data-end=\"947\">have physical cash delivered to their doorstep<\/strong>. While full details about the cash delivery feature remain limited, Robinhood noted that availability will vary by location.<\/p>\n<p class data-start=\"1074\" data-end=\"1348\">At launch, Robinhood Banking will support <strong data-start=\"1116\" data-end=\"1149\">individual and joint accounts<\/strong>, with <strong data-start=\"1156\" data-end=\"1179\">children\u2019s accounts<\/strong> expected in future updates. According to <strong data-start=\"1221\" data-end=\"1235\">Deepak Rao<\/strong>, GM of Robinhood Money, the platform is designed to solve common frustrations with traditional banking services.<\/p>\n<p class data-start=\"1350\" data-end=\"1675\">In addition, Robinhood introduced <strong data-start=\"1384\" data-end=\"1408\">Robinhood Strategies<\/strong>, a new wealth management tool available now for Gold subscribers. This feature offers <strong data-start=\"1495\" data-end=\"1526\">actively managed portfolios<\/strong> of stocks and ETFs, focused on diversification and growth. The service charges a <strong data-start=\"1608\" data-end=\"1628\">0.25% annual fee<\/strong>, capped at <strong data-start=\"1640\" data-end=\"1657\">$250 per year<\/strong> for Gold members.<\/p>\n<p class data-start=\"1677\" data-end=\"1753\">Robinhood Strategies will become available to all users starting next month.<\/p>\n<p class data-start=\"1755\" data-end=\"1998\">The company is also working on <strong data-start=\"1786\" data-end=\"1796\">Cortex<\/strong>, an <strong data-start=\"1801\" data-end=\"1836\">AI-powered investment assistant<\/strong> that will analyze market trends, provide investment insights, and recommend stocks. Set to launch later this year, Cortex will be accessible to Gold subscribers.<\/p>\n<p class data-start=\"2000\" data-end=\"2318\">These new services reflect Robinhood\u2019s continued evolution from a free trading app into a full-service financial ecosystem. With tools for <strong data-start=\"2139\" data-end=\"2185\">banking, investing, and AI-driven insights<\/strong>, Robinhood aims to compete with both fintech disruptors and established banks in managing the <strong data-start=\"2280\" data-end=\"2317\">entire customer financial journey<\/strong>.<\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Robinhood is moving closer to becoming a comprehensive personal finance platform.
