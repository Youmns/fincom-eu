Increases in new filed and resolved complaints amounts sought, as well as average complaint values, suggest traders are continuing to try and take advantage of market opportunities. At the same time, non-trading complaints rose 35% during the month, indicating that traders may be having issues with such things as bonuses or brokerage terms and conditions.\u00a0 Roughly 23% of all new complaints filed with the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) in July were valued between $1,000-$10K+, highlighting the continued importance of the organization to investigate complaints with a significant monetary value. During the month, the DRC was able to resolve 58% more complaints than in June, with average resolution times improving 33% to a still manageable 6.5 days.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Financial Commission has conducted dispute resolution services specifically for FX and CFD traders and broker member firms since 2013 as an independent, non-governmental self-regulatory organization and external dispute resolution (EDR) forum.
