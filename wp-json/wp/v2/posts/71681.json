Even then, there is no assurance that the case will be\u00a0fully investigated properly and result in the right outcome.Thus, many smaller complaints can fall to the wayside.<\/p>\n<p>Financial Commission provides value to traders and brokers in such cases and helps potentially amend broken relationships and avoid subsequent negative reviews from clients whom would otherwise feel wronged.<\/p>\n<p>Financial Commission has found through its research that even in highly regulated environments the available channels to resolve\u00a0customer complaints can be costly and inefficient or fast yet ineffective. Ideally, channels should be effective, fast, and affordable,\u00a0and are all aspects that Financial Commission organically achieves due to its organizational structure.<\/p>\n<p>Legal options such as the domestic courts mentioned within broker-client account agreements should be a very last option, and not\u00a0the goto place for clients when they are unable to resolve their complaints directly with their broker, meanwhile, these agreement are\u00a0referenced by Financial Commission in cases where compliance with the agreement is in question by either or both sides.<\/p>\n<p>Financial Commission supports the self-regulatory efforts of financial markets participants through its voluntary membership\u00a0structure.This allows brands that are either unregulated or highly regulated to become members of the Financial Commission and show clients their level of commitment to integrity and in treating them fairly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Dedicated to Education<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Financial Commission has observed that customer complaints often stem from a misunderstanding about how a product works, and\u00a0subsequent experience while trading, and then revert back to the broker with a sense of the broker being responsible for the experience. However, also observed is that when brokers are at fault the reasons aren\u2019t always easily evident to their staff, unless\u00a0detailed investigations are done, or advanced reporting and tracking is readily available.<\/p>\n<p>Financial Commission is dedicated to broker education\u00a0as much as it is to client education,\u00a0as complaints often stem from misunderstandings, as is such in nearly all human dealings and consumer\/company relationships education helps improve understandings.
