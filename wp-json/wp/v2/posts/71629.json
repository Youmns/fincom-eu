The dispute situation occurred on Feb 28, 2014.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">On that day a short position was opened by EA on the instrument USDJPY:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">2014.02.28 00:00:56 &#8216;XXXXX&#8217;: order #ZZZZZ, sell 0.33 USDJPY at 102.23200<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Immediately after position opening the EA had set a pair of OCO orders (Stop Loss and Take Profit):<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">00:00:57.353 &#8216;XXXXX&#8217;: order #ZZZZZ sell 0.33 USDJPY at 102.232 was modified -&gt; sl: 102.422 tp: 102.162<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">A few minutes later the EA changed the parameters of OCO orders (Stop Loss and Take Profit):<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">00:05:50.151 &#8216;XXXXX&#8217;: order #ZZZZZ sell 0.33 USDJPY at 102.232 was modified -&gt; sl: 102.192 tp: 102.162<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Finally, the client`s position # ZZZZZ was closed after market price had reached Take Profit level. This fact was confirmed by the log file of the broker`s server:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">2014.02.28 00:11:29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 &#8216;XXXXX&#8217; order #ZZZZZ take profit 0.33 &#8216;USDJPY&#8217; closed at 102.16200<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">2014.02.28 00:11:29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 &#8216;XXXXX&#8217;: order #ZZZZZ sell 0.33 &#8216;USDJPY&#8217; closed at 102.15700<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">The dispute between two parties aroused because subsequently the broker completely annulled the deal on the instrument USDJPY, justifying his actions by the fact that at the time of client`s order execution (02\/28\/14 00:00, MT4 platform time) there was a \u201cnon-market spike\u201d\u00a0 on the instrument USDJPY which was registered on the ECN server. As a result, the prices had been recognized as non-market by liquidity provider, and position # ZZZZZ was canceled, which is confirmed by the server log file:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">2014.02.28 02:09:12 order #ZZZZZ for &#8216;XXXXX&#8217; deleted &#8211; sell 0.33 USDJPY at 102.23200, profit: 24.23<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\">The complainant believes that the broker distorts price feed and utilizes price manipulation practices. According to the client a fair resolution of the dispute would be to require the broker to compensate his unrealized profit which was cancelled due to annulled deal. Also, he insists on public recognition of the fact that price distortions on the ECN server resulted from broker`s manipulation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">DRC DECISION<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\" width=\"638\"><b>Financial Commission Complaint Response<\/b><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" width=\"327\"><b>Name of the Applicant<\/b><\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" width=\"312\"><b>Broker &#8211; Company<\/b><b> <\/b><b><\/b><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" width=\"327\">CLIENT<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">BROKER<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" width=\"327\">Complaint to Financial Commission<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" width=\"312\"># \u0425\u0425<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" width=\"327\">Date of complaint<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">Date of complaint submission<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" width=\"327\">28\/2\/2014<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\" width=\"312\">31\/3\/2014<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\" valign=\"top\" width=\"638\"><b>Complaint Matter<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">CLEINT submitted a complaint to the Financial Commission regarding the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Trading account number XXXXX.<\/p>\n<p>Short position on USD\/JPY, opened with the help of the expert advisor and subsequently closed after reaching Take-Profit order, was completely annulled by broker:<\/p>\n<p>Ticket ZZZZZ sell 0.33 USDJPY @ 102.23200 sl: 102.192 tp: 102.162<\/p>\n<p>Client demands compensation for lost profit because he believes that the cancellation of the position was ungrounded.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\" valign=\"top\" width=\"638\"><b>Complaint Response<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Decision on the complaint was made on the basis of information provided by the BROKER and the CLIENT.After analyzing the information, members of the Dispute Resolution Committee came to the conclusion that the broker had no grounds for cancelling the client\u2019s trading action, which led to the opening of the short position, as it was the result of the natural price movement.
