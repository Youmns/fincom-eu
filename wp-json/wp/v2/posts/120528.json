Increases in trading related complaints suggest more traders are taking advantage of market opportunities and having issues with trade execution or pricing. Roughly 25% of all new complaints filed with the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) in March were valued at $1,000-$9,999, highlighting the continued importance of the organization to investigate complaints with a significant monetary value. During the month, the DRC was able to ramp up the resolution of cases with total resolved complaints rising 10% from February while maintaining a steady average resolution time of 8.3 days.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Founded in 2013, the Financial Commission is a leading independent member-driven external dispute resolution (EDR) organization for international online brokerages, exchanges and Blockchain firms that participate in global foreign exchange (forex), derivatives, CFD and digital asset markets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Financial Commission provides efficient compliance solutions to its members, alongside its External Dispute Resolution (EDR) mechanism that serves as an effective channel for processing complaints from clients of member firms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information please contact us at <\/span><a href=\"mailto:info@financialcommission.org\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">info@financialcommission.org<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>April 7th 2021, The Financial Commission today announces increases in newly filed complaints, resolved complaints, as well as awards to traders and amounts sought from member brokers for March 2021 as part of its monthly Complaints Digest.
