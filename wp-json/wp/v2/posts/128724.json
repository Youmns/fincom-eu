Slowdowns in filed and resolved complaints, as well as compensation sought suggest traders may be finding less opportunities on traditional markets in light of range bound price fluctuations or simply forwent trading at the end of the year. In 4Q 2022 the organization also experienced a drop in most amounts sought metrics, except those attributed to members. There was a noticeable change in the complaints topics for the period, with trading-related complaints rising 5% month-over-month despite the general drop in new complaints for the quarter. Complaints listed in the value category $1-10K and $10K+ increased their overall share of complaints 5%, highlighting the continued importance of the organization to investigate complaints with higher monetary values. During the quarter, the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) managed to accumulate less complaint investigations carrying over into the New Year, as compared to 3Q, while experiencing a rise in already exceptional average resolution times, which still continue to outpace alternative EDR services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Financial Commission has conducted dispute resolution services specifically for FX and CFD traders and broker member firms since 2013 as an independent, non-governmental self-regulatory organization and external dispute resolution (EDR) forum.
