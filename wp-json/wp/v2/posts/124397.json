Takeaways<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Commission experienced another record-setting year in 2021 with traders submitting a record number of complaints and seeking a record amount of compensation while awarding a smaller amount of compensation to traders and resolving disputes in just 7.1 days on average<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organization expanded its international presence by <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">19% as compared to

consultants.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Conclusions<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Financial Commission continued to provide quick and efficient dispute resolution services to traders and broker members in 2021 despite continued global disruptions related to Covid-19. Continued demand from retail traders and new investors provided for a record amount of new complaints for the organization and led to new records in operational metrics.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The organization further expanded its membership ranks with large, internationally recognized brokers, as well as new members in the Middle East region. The organization\u2019s free dispute resolution service to traders gained popularity in Asia, Latin America and Europe with new complaints from these regions growing 98%, 87% and 20% respectively, while complaints from the Middle East grew substantially by 357% in 2021. The Financial Commission also saw a continued decrease of 47% in complaints from Russia and former Soviet republics, as local market restrictions continued to impede the normal online trading operations FX and CFD traders had come to expect in the past.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of complaints in 2021 were related to non-trading issues with 58% of the total, while financial related disputes accounted for 23% and trading related complaints 19%. The most popular topics for complaints dealt with account blocking (32%), funds withdrawal (17%), price check (13%), non-market quotes (8%) and stop-out orders (6%). Of all resolved complaints, 59% were resolved \u201cin favour of the broker\u201d and 10% resolved \u201cin favour of the client\u201d, while 30% were found to be outside the organization\u2019s jurisdiction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heading into 2022, the Financial Commission expects to see global demand for trading and investing services continue to rise, particularly among younger generations of trades, with opportunities for volatility in prices of financial products, including commodities, energies and equities as a result of changes in fiscal economic policies and impacts from the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0 In this regard, the organization is prepared to handle a growing number of new complaints from traders in the New Year.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Financial Commission has conducted dispute resolution services specifically for FX and CFD traders and broker member firms since 2013 as an independent, non-governmental self-regulatory organization and external dispute resolution (EDR) forum.
