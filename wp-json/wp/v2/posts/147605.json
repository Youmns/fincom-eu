A spokesperson for the company noted:<\/p>\n<p>a spokesperson stated: \u201cCapital.com has made the strategic decision to temporarily pause new client onboarding in the UK. This is to ensure we continue to deliver an uncompromised level of service to our existing clients in the UK as we experience rapid and unprecedented growth in new and emerging markets. This temporary pause will allow us to ensure all our systems, controls, products and services meet the stringent standards demanded by our valued clients, management, shareholders, and regulators. This is a proactive measure that aligns with our long-term vision of delivering sustainable growth and operational excellence. During this time, people resident in the UK who are not existing clients will not be able to open a new account with Capital Com UK Limited. All existing UK clients with an active account will not be affected and can continue to deposit or withdraw funds, add additional sub-accounts, and trade as normal. Capital.com continues to operate a full service in all other markets. We remain committed to supporting our clients and expect to start onboarding new clients again in the UK in due course.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"11:1-11:25\"><strong>Strong UK Performance<\/strong><\/p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"13:1-13:325\">Despite the pause, Capital.com&#8217;s UK business has seen significant recent growth.
