Relatively lower numbers for newly filed complaints and increases in resolved complaints suggest traders are continuing to try and take advantage of market opportunities with the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) continuing to process a significant amount of complaints in the last quarter of the year. The DRC was able to award a smaller amount of compensation to traders than in the previous month while experiencing a jump in the amounts sought by traders from broker members in November.\u00a0 At the same time, over 22% of all new complaints filed with the DRC in November were valued between $1,000-$10K+, highlighting the continued importance of the organization to investigate complaints with a significant monetary value. During the month, the DRC was able to resolve 2% more complaints than in October with some complaint investigations and decisions carrying over into November, while improving average resolution times, which still continue to outpace alternative EDR services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Financial Commission has conducted dispute resolution services specifically for FX and CFD traders and broker member firms since 2013 as an independent, non-governmental self-regulatory organization and external dispute resolution (EDR) forum.
