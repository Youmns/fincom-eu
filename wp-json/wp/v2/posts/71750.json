a broker can commingle its own money into client\u2019s accounts to help maintain excess capital and avoid a shortfall in the required margin (i.e. during periods of high volatility).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The author argued that <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">commingling<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a broker\u2019s own money into clients trust accounts could blur the line between the funds belonging to the trust and that of the broker\u2019s money in the case of insolvency.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, brokers that can use client money to hedge and for margining purpose endorses the idea that not all brokers who are the counterparty to a client\u2019s trade are acting as market-makers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, permitting the use of client funds for hedging and margining could blur the line between proprietary trading and the hedging that is common for a matched principal. The author also pointed out the systemic risk that exists with client segregated accounts when the funds are pooled together in the same account, and how this could be remedied if it was required that each client\u2019s funds be held in a separate bank account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cathie Armour, a Commissioner at the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) commented regarding the rule changes: \u201cThe amendments to the client money regime made in the Bill have strengthened the protection of client money that is provided to retail derivative clients. Doing so will help to increase investor confidence in the Australian financial system.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophie Gerber, Director of Traction Fintech commented in the article, \u201cThis has been a very divisive issue in the industry. \u00a0What may have been a more beneficial approach to this issue would be to have disallowed the use of the Corporations Act provisions for using client money for margining\/hedging etc. with related parties and also prohibiting the payment of any form of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">conflicted remuneration<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in these relationships. \u00a0Time will show us whether these reforms have or have not benefited the industry, I think, unfortunately, in this case, the retail client will not see any benefits, and over the next few years the outcomes will be reduced competition and increased costs.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The author noted that despite the rule revisions client\u2019s money is still pooled in the same bank account and not protected from counter-party risk in the case of broker insolvency. He added how ASIC\u2019s prohibition of allowing a buffer contrasted with other jurisdictions where maintaining excess capital is required for instance in the US.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Leverage <\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As leveraged forex and CFD trading are done from a margin account, the minimum margin requirements often vary from broker to broker with a wave of restrictions in recent years reducing the maximum leverage that can be offered in different countries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The author explained that leverage is often blamed as the cause for clients\u2019 losses, and while such restrictions have been put in place in many major jurisdictions, the UK has yet to put in place a cap. And while high leverage has been appealing for many traders, in jurisdictions such as Japan, a reduction of leverage doesn\u2019t appear to have hindered its retail forex industry, as lower leverage may have instead helped it become a more accepted asset class for household investors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The article cited an extensive list of industry news articles including announcements from regulators, to see the full article <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/tractionfintech.com\/uk\/blog\/comparison-regulators-rules-cfds-forex\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">click here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a9\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/tractionfintech.com\/uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Traction Fintech<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>August 3, 2017: Financial Commission, a leading External Dispute Resolution (EDR) organization, operated by FinaCom PLC, servicing online Forex and CFD brokerages and technology providers within the financial services industry, today announces support for the recent findings in a report published by Traction Fintech.
