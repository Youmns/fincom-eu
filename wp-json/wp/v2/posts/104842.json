But from March 1 to January 1, 2020, the tax rate for this category of taxpayers changed to a commonly established rate of 18%.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Market participants, represented by Belarusian forex dealers, regarded the indefinite exemption of their current and potential customers from taxes as a step aimed at developing the national forex sector and attracting new traders on the background of tightening regulation in neighboring and other regions. \u201cThis initiative, of course, makes the Belarusian jurisdiction even more attractive for traders and investors from other countries. This is a very important step towards the interests of traders, which speaks of a deep understanding of the market and progressive tax system,\u201d commented Alpari Eurasia on the new tax legislation in the Belarussian forex market.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Making such amendments, the regulator took into account statistics, according to which approximately 80% of OTC market users lose their money. Accordingly, it is more rational to rely on the profit of the companies than on a small fraction of profitable customers. And the development of the sector by attracting customers as a whole will serve the interests of both parties, regardless of who is charged the tax. Thus, as a result of the exemption from tax on average of every fifth client and a 7% increase in income tax for 16 current forex dealers, more likely will benefit state treasury even more.<\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Belarusian authorities once again extended the tax credit for customers of licensed forex dealers.
