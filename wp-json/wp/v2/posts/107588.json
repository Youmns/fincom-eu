While FX and derivatives can only be traded by companies that have been authorized by the regulator in Brazil, there is no civil law prohibiting Brazilians from opening trading accounts at overseas companies for the purpose of trading FX and derivatives. This is similar to a situation faced by brokers who provide trading and support services in the Russian language, which are popular with Russian residents, who are meant to be trading only with firms licensed by the Central Bank of Russia (CBR).<\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Australian and UK regulated broker, Pepperstone Group has recently come under scrutiny from Brazilian regulators regarding the onboarding of Brazilian residents as clients in the broker\u2019s affiliated European entity.
