Increases in new filed and resolved complaints suggest traders are continuing to try and take advantage of market opportunities with the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) continuing to process a larger number of complaints than previous months. The DRC was able to award a smaller amount of compensation to traders in the previous month while experiencing a significant jump in the amount sought in all submitted complaints.\u00a0 At the same time, over 23% of all new complaints filed with the DRC in September were valued between $1,000-$10K+, highlighting the continued importance of the organization to investigate complaints with a significant monetary value. During the month, the DRC was able to resolve 33% more complaints than in August with continued operating efficiencies, while the rise in newly filed complaints led to an uptick in average resolution times, which still continue to outpace alternative EDR services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Financial Commission has conducted dispute resolution services specifically for FX and CFD traders and broker member firms since 2013 as an independent, non-governmental self-regulatory organization and external dispute resolution (EDR) forum.
