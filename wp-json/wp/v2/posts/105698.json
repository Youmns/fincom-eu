As such, the industry should be prepared to see similar results from other, comparable brokers as more financial results become publicly available.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Indeed, a further reduction in leverage in Australia and other regulated jurisdictions can have a further impact on broker operations, which are exposed to Australian customers and make the option of setting up an offshore, albeit regulated entity ever more attractive.<\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The well-known UK regulated broker Plus500 Ltd (LON:PLUS), which is part of Playtech Group, has reported some disappointing preliminary revenue figures for 2019.
