At the same time, the broker is promising to re-establish any open traders or orders in the customers\u2019 new accounts if they agree to the transfer.<\/p>\n<p>Since client funds will be held in accordance with \u201cBaFin\u2019s client money rules\u201d customers accounts are expected to be regulated by the German financial regulator and there is no word yet on any impacts to leverage, commissions, or other trade settings provided to customers when they were trading via the UK.
