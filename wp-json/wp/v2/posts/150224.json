Morgan Asset Management (J.P. Morgan), one of the world\u2019s most trusted asset management firms. The J.P. Morgan underlying funds hold the highest rating from Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s at \u2018AAAm\u2019 grade, and equally high ratings from all leading rating agencies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since its launch, Airwallex Yield has been available to businesses with a minimum investment of AUD $500K or USD equivalent. To date, Airwallex Capital Pty Ltd has attracted over AUD$100M in funds under management from customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Airwallex Yield has been designed to be a competitive alternative for businesses as its returns more closely track the RBA cash rate than the rates offered by traditional providers \u2013 a priority in this high inflation environment. Businesses could earn more than triple the amount of a saver account with a big four bank by investing with Yield.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yield\u2019s underlying fund, JPMorgan Liquidity Fund, offers a daily return of 3.67 percent on AUD balances and 3.95 percent on USD balances, compared to an average of 1.06 percent per annum for business saver accounts with the big banks for AUD and 0.50 percent per annum for USD*.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Yield for Flexibility, Attractive Rates, and Multi-Currency Capabilities<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shannon Scott, SVP of Product at Airwallex, said: \u201cWe\u2019re excited to expand upon Yield to position Airwallex as the modern alternative to banks for businesses of all sizes. This move into investment products underscores our role as a comprehensive financial services platform that can help businesses manage their finances more efficiently. It\u2019s especially timely as Australian SMEs face economic challenges and rising costs. Yield empowers them with its flexibility, attractive rates of return and multi-currency capabilities \u2013 a solution businesses have been craving for years.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">George Boubouras, Managing Director, Research, Investments &amp; Advisory at K2 Asset Management Ltd (an Airwallex partner and issuer of the Yield product) said: \u201cCross-border trading companies can benefit from exposure to money market funds that are currently taking advantage of the higher yields on offer due to the higher Fed Funds cash rate in the US and domestically the higher cash rate set by the RBA. The benefits of a blended single multi-currency cash account that offers exposure to multiple currencies in a single account can assist with lower transaction costs and shorter settlement times compared to traditional currency accounts that offer lower yields and are more burdensome.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matthew Le, Head of South East Asia &amp; Australia Sales, Global Liquidity, J.P.
