Interactive Brokers initially entered the crypto market in July 2021, focusing on retail investors before expanding to institutional customers in the United States. The recent move to include UK customers allows both retail and institutional investors to engage in the growing digital asset market.<\/p>\n<p>Eligible UK customers of Interactive Brokers can manage traditional securities and digital assets accounts opened at Paxos Trust Company through a single, unified platform.<\/p>\n<p><strong>New Crypto Regulations in the UK<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>New regulations in the UK require firms <a href=\"https:\/\/financefeeds.com\/google-reverses-ban-crypto-ads-maintains-restrictions-defi-icos\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">promoting crypto products<\/a> or services to include clear risk warnings and ensure that investors have the necessary knowledge and experience to invest in cryptocurrencies.
