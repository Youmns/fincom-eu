In supporting this conclusion the Client argues that the investment consultant: opened too many trades, did not employ simple rules of equity management, placed trades in products with high spreads, frequent use of hedging in trading. The Client is requesting the Broker to return funds in the amount of $16343 that were deposit in the trading account.

The appropriate risk disclosures were provided to the Client in electronic format during the account opening process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #003366;\">Moreover, the Broker indicated that all trades conducted on the Client\u2019s account were made either directly by the Client or by the investment consultant after receiving verbal confirmation from the Client.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #003366;\">Following the Dispute Resolution Committee\u2019s decision in the case, the Broker did not satisfy the DRC\u2019s decision to compensate the client within 28 days, according to the Rules and Guidelines of the Financial Commission. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #003366;\">Because the Broker failed to satisfy the decision, the Commission took emergency action to assist the Client and invoked the use of the Compensation Fund to compensate the Client for their losses identified in the DRC decision. As a result, the Client was awarded the maximum amount of $5000 from the Compensation Fund, as the Broker was a Category B member.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #003366;\">Furthermore, the Commission took action and expelled the Broker\u2019s membership with the Financial Commission. <\/span><\/p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Complainant<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Broker<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">XXX<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">YYY<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Financial Commission Complaint<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">#ZZZ<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Complaint Raising Date<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Complaint Filing Date<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">30\/11\/2016<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">11\/01\/2017<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\"><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\"><strong>Complaint response:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The decision for this complaint is based on the information provided by the Client and the Broker.<\/p>\n<p>To ensure an objective investigation of the incident, the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) of the Financial Commission closely examined the documentary evidence provided by the parties to the dispute. Having analyzed the materials of the complaint, the Dispute Resolution Committee has come to the following conclusions:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>With regards to the financial losses incurred by the Client due to the trading conducted by the investment consultant it is necessary to note that the Client should have been aware of all the risk associated with using or not using any trading strategy provided by the investment consultant:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to section 7 of the Customer Agreement<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>7.1 The Company does not consult the Client on the benefits of any specific trade order or otherwise provide any other consulting regarding investments, and the Client agrees that the services do not include investment consultations on financial instruments, base markets or equity. The Client makes trading decisions exclusively of their own accord, including to place trading orders.<\/p>\n<p>7.2 The Company is not required to provide any legal, tax or other advise associated with any trades.

This is confirmed by audio recordings provided by the client.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Nonetheless, there is one instance which points to the responsibility of the Broker for partial losses incurred on the Client\u2019s account. In particular, the Broker could not provide the Dispute Resolution Committee comments on trade #XXXXXX, which, according to the account statements provided by the Broker was closed at an off market rate (i.e. without the spread amount of 2 RUB). This fact puts into question the validity of trade \u00a0#XXXXXX and all other subsequent trades in the account (including trade #ZZZZZ), which led to the liquidation of positions on the account and subsequent losses.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>In response to its questions the DRC did not receive in a timely matter other evidence requested from the Broker, including trading server logs indicating tick pricing on the USDRUB currency pair at the time of the incident.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>As such, having reviewed all the facts and circumstances of the dispute, the DRC has come to unanimous agreement that trades #XXXXX and ZZZZZZ) conducted on trading account #XXXXX should be deemed invalid and the results of these trades annulled. Given this determination, the Broker must compensate the Client for losses incurred with trades #XXXXX and #ZZZZZZ in the sum of $9233.90.<\/p>\n<p>This complaint was reviewed by the members of the Dispute Resolution Committee of the Financial Commission and was processed by the Head of the Committee.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Ruled in Favor<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Compensation<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Client<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">$9233.90<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\">If you have any questions regarding this investigation, please send them to the following address info@financialcommission.org<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\">Acknowledgement<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\">I certify that all information was considered by the Dispute Resolution Committee of the Financial Commission and hereby confirm that the decision was made fairly, impartially and without interference.
