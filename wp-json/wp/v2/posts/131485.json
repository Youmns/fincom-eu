Specifically, the organization experienced virtually no material change in new complaints filed, as well as in the total number of complaints resolved in the quarter. Nonetheless, complaints amounts sought and awarded, as well as average complaint values changed significantly due to several high-value complaints resolved during the previous quarter. In this regard, the total amounts sought from traders equaled $4.4M for the quarter, 66% lower than 2Q 2023. At the same time, amounts awarded to traders experienced a significant jump to $331,809. Complaints with higher values also experienced significant increases, with complaints valued between $1K-10K jumping 141% QoQ and those valued at $10K+ rising 29%.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was also a noticeable increase in the complaints topics for the period, with increases in trading-related (7% QoQ) and non-trading-related (4% QoQ) complaints, which indicate that traders are continuing to find trading opportunities, even in possible narrow price ranges in FX and CFD markets.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the period, the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) managed to accumulate 17% fewer complaint investigations carrying over into 3Q, while experiencing an improvement in average resolution times.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Financial Commission is an independent external dispute resolution (EDR) organization for consumers\/traders who are unable to resolve disputes directly with their financial services providers who are members of the Financial Commission. The Financial Commission initially set out to provide a new approach for traders and brokers alike to resolve any issues that arise in the course of trading electronic markets such as Foreign Exchange, and then expanded into CFDs and related derivatives, in addition to certifying technology platforms used for trading.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information please contact us at <\/span><a href=\"mailto:info@financialcommission.org\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">info@financialcommission.org<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Financial Commission, a leading independent, non-governmental self-regulatory organization and external dispute resolution (EDR) forum, announces increases in several key operational metrics, including amounts awarded to traders, and trade-related complaints as part of its quarterly Complaints Digest.
