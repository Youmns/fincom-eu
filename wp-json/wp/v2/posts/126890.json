attributed to a rise in filed and resolved complaints of 5% and 6% respectively in the first half of 2022<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amount of compensation sought by traders totalled over $5.36M and included a large proportion of \u201cnon-trading related\u201d disputes resolved by the organization<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traders were awarded less compensation in the first half of 2022 as compared to 2nd half of last year due to an increased proportion of complaints being ruled as \u201cnon-specified\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The average value of

public inquiries during continued market volatility around the world, with total resolved complaints for the 1st half of 2022 being 6% higher than 2H 2021. The drop in average complaints values and changes in the complaints value categories suggest that many new investors have entered the market on the heels of significant equity and crypto market growth that occurred in the later stages of 2021.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Dispute Resolution Committee witnessed a rise in compensation sought from member brokers of 26%, indicating the rise in demand for trading services among Financial Commission members, while also experiencing a drop of 66% in compensation sought from non-members, suggesting that warnings and notices issued regularly by the Financial Commission and financial regulators worldwide may be deterring investors from becoming victims of untrustworthy companies and exchanges.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The continued effectiveness of the dispute resolution service is also highlighted by the 12% rise in member complaints for the half year. \u201cNon-trading related\u201d complaints continue to grow with a\u00a0 5% uptick to 1112 in this time period, highlighting the broad scope of issues experienced by traders today.
