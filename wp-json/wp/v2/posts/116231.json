According to the statement from FMA, the regulator was contacted by a woman who had tried to transfer a significant amount of money from China to New Zealand, saying she and her family had been \u201cstranded in New Zealand\u201d due to COVID-19 and had needed the money for living expenses.<\/p>\n<p>She said she had seen an advertisement on a community news outlet offering money transfer services, and arranged the transfer via WeChat. The money was sent to a bank in Inner Mongolia.<\/p>\n<p>However, when the money didn\u2019t arrive, the woman was told it had been \u201cfrozen\u201d by the FMA due to money laundering suspicions. She was later phoned by a man posing as an FMA official, falsely saying she would have to pay more to release the original sum \u2013 which, unfortunately, she did.x<\/p>\n<p>Liam Mason, FMA Director of Regulation, said it was a troubling case, targeting those affected by the pandemic, and impersonating a government agency in order to steal more. Mr. Mason added \u201cbe sure to only transfer money through businesses on New Zealand\u2019s Financial Service Providers Register. Don\u2019t fall for the scammers\u2019 line that you must pay more money to release your original funds. And know that the FMA would never freeze money remittance or ask you to pay any money.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t miss the latest news and discussion on our Telegram channel. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/Financialcommission\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe today<\/a>!<\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>New Zealand\u2019s Financial Markets Authority (FMA) has warned the public about a new financial scam affecting the regulator.
