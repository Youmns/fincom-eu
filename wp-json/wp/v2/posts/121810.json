Continued interest in trading opportunities in global markets has resulted in more demand for trading services among broker members, who have adapted their internal dispute resolution (IDR) processes to the influx of new traders seen in 2020 and, as such, have led to the reduction of compensation amounts sought from their trades. The Dispute Resolution Committee witnessed a significant rise in compensation sought from non-member brokers of 217%, indicating that trader protections are still lacking around the world. Several key outliers in amounts awarded to traders and average complaint values have negatively impacted 1H 2021 results, yet these metrics reflect the continued effectiveness of the dispute resolution service. \u201cTrading related\u201d complaints rose by 19% for the first half of 2021, while \u201cnon-trading related\u201d complaints more than doubled to 325 in this time period, highlighting the broad scope of issues experienced by traders today. The highest trending complaints topics included account blocking, withdrawal of funds and price check requests further highlighting the continued interest in trading FX and CFD markets by traders of all experience levels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Founded in 2013, the Financial Commission is a leading independent member-driven external dispute resolution (EDR) organization for international online brokerages, exchanges and Blockchain firms that participate in global foreign exchange (forex), derivatives, CFD and digital asset markets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Financial Commission provides efficient compliance solutions to its members, alongside its External Dispute Resolution (EDR) mechanism that serves as an effective channel for processing complaints from clients of member firms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information please contact us at <\/span><a href=\"mailto:info@financialcommission.com.co\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">info@financialcommission.com.co<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>July 13th,\u00a0 2021, The Financial Commission today announces its operating metrics for the first half of 2021 as part of its ongoing Complaints Digest publications highlighting the organization\u2019s performance.
