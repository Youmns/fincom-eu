#003366;\"> since the president Trump\u2019s speech was scheduled later that day. \u00a0However, after some time she discovered that her trading platform lost connection with the server. She contacted two representatives of the Broker\u2019s via Facebook chat but didn\u2019t get any useful advice or help from them. <\/span>Market<span style=\"color: #003366;\"> experienced a round of high volatility after the president Trump started to deliver his speech. This, in turn, caused widening of the spread in the financial instrument GBPUSD. As a result, all Client\u2019s positions were liquidated by the Broker due to <\/span>deficit<span style=\"color: #003366;\"> of margin (Stop Out).<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #003366;\">The Client believes that all losses on her trading account were incurred by the technical update of the server on Broker\u2019s side. Client claims that she was unable to connect to the server and failed to manage her open positions as well as establish new hedge positions for the period of two hours. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #003366;\">In connection with the above, the Client requests the Dispute Resolution Committee of the Financial Commission to investigate the incident and believes that the Broker should compensate all losses ($3772) incurred from the technical issue mentioned above. The Client provided the screenshots of the frozen terminal taken at the time of the incident, the records from the terminal logs taken from two different PCs, as well as the screenshots of Facebook chat, as documentary evidence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #003366;\">For his part, the Broker does not see any grounds for the Client&#8217;s complaint, as in his opinion, all Client&#8217;s positions were closed correctly, at real market prices and in accordance with the provisions of the regulatory documents. The Broker claims that no upgrades were released during market hours on January 25-26, 2018 and the Client was served as honestly and professionally as always, <\/span>however information<span style=\"color: #003366;\"> provided by the Client contains some accusations towards the company that <\/span>are<span style=\"color: #003366;\"> based on non-existent and distorted factual circumstances presented in the complaint.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #003366;\">Because this case involved specific trades conducted by the client, the complaint was classified as a \u201ctrade-related\u201d dispute. Unfortunately, the DRC was unable to receive necessary server logs and other information from the Broker to conduct a thorough analysis of the trades in question.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #003366;\">As such, the DRC had to rely on all factual and documentary evidence provided by both <\/span>broker<span style=\"color: #003366;\"> and client to issue a decision and was not able to independently verify pricing and tick data. Given the abundance of evidence of a technical malfunction on the Broker\u2019s trading server and the reluctance of the Broker to provide additional information from their execution venue for review of trade executions, the DRC issued a decision in the client\u2019s favor in full.<\/span><\/p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Complainant<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Broker<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">XXX<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">YYY<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Financial Commission Complaint<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">#ZZZ<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Complaint Raising Date<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Complaint Filing Date<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">26\/01\/2018<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">29\/01\/2018<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\"><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\"><strong>Complaint response:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The decision on this complaint is based on the information provided by Mrs. XXXXXX and the brokerage company XXXXX.<\/p>\n<p>After a comprehensive analysis of the documentary evidence provided by the Client and \u00a0the Broker the Dispute Resolution Committee of the Financial Commission has come to the following conclusions:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, it should be noted that the Client has provided significant evidence of system failure. The records from two different terminal logs, as well as screenshots of the frozen trading platform provided by the Client, show the same technical problem &#8211; multiple failed trials of the Client to connect to the server.<\/li>\n<li>Also, it should be noted, that the Broker refused to provide server logs which can show whether the XXX server was running at the time of the incident or not. Server logs contain not only the trading operations but also various service records, which make it possible to understand that the trading server was turned on and worked normally. These logs were not provided to DRC members for review.<\/li>\n<li>Taking into account the documentary evidence provided by the Client (screenshots from Facebook), the experts of the DRC have come to the conclusion that at the time of the incident the Client was trying to contact Broker\u2019s representatives in order to resolve the problem with her trading account. In turn, the Broker\u2019s staff had a good opportunity to explain to the Client that there are alternative ways to close positions but refused to do so.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Summarizing all the above the Dispute Resolution Committee ruled in favor of the Client. Members of the Committee believe that canceling the financial results of the disputed transactions is a fair decision in this case. Accordingly, the Broker should compensate the losses of the Client in the amount of $3772.<\/p>\n<p>This complaint was reviewed by the members of the Dispute Resolution Committee of the Financial Commission and was processed by the Head of the Committee.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Ruled in Favor<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Compensation<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Client<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">3772.00 USD<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\">If you have any questions regarding this investigation, please send them to the following address info@financialcommission.org<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\">Acknowledgement<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\">I certify that all information was considered by the Dispute Resolution Committee of the Financial Commission and hereby confirm that the decision was made fairly, impartially and without interference.
