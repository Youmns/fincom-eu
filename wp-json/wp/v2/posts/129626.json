There was also noticeable change in the complaints topics for the period, with increases in trading-related and financial-related complaints, which indicate that traders are back to finding opportunities in the markets. In 1Q 2023 the organization also experienced an increase in amounts sought from non-member firms, indicating the significant number of investors, who do not have access to external dispute resolution (EDR) services today. Complaints filed and resolved in the first quarter of 2023 were also more valuable, with those in the $500-999 and $1,000-9,999 categories increasing 48% and 54%, respectively &#8211; highlighting the continued importance of the organization to investigate complaints with higher monetary values. During the quarter, the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) managed to accumulate less complaint investigations carrying over into 2Q, while experiencing an improvement in already exceptional average resolution times, which still continue to outpace alternative EDR services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Financial Commission has conducted dispute resolution services specifically for FX and CFD traders and broker member firms since 2013 as an independent, non-governmental self-regulatory organization and external dispute resolution (EDR) forum.
