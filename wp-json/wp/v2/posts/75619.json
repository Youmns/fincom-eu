The publicly available information is valuable in both educating traders, as well as improving the services and products offered by brokers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cases involving Compensation Fund awards<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The cases published today highlight the issues faced by customers of a particular broker member of the Commission and the way in which the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) accepted the complaint, conducted the investigatory and determination phases and ultimately reached a judgement.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Each case is important in its own right, but both illustrate the ways in which the Commission handles situations where the broker member refuses to honor the DRC\u2019s decision and\/or pay the client an award as part of the judgement. Particularly, the actions the Committee took after informing the parties of its decision ensured that the customers were compensated for their losses and that the trading community was informed of the broker\u2019s change in membership status with the Commission.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To review the new published cases, please click <a href=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/2018\/04\/11\/customer-complaint-dated-november-30th-2016\/\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/2018\/04\/11\/customer-complaint-dated-december-12th-2016\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What is the Compensation Fund?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Compensation Fund acts as an insurance policy for members\u2019 clients.
