Echoing these short-term changes the Financial Commission experienced a slowdown in several key metrics, including average complaints value, amounts sought by traders, and total new complaints. Financial-related complaints continued to dominate, indicating that traders are continuing to deal with issues related to funds withdrawal, rather than trading, as witnessed in previous months. At the same time, the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) awarded significantly more compensation to traders in September than previous months, while increasing average dispute resolution times in order to provide sound and reasonable resolutions to traders.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Founded in 2013, the Financial Commission is a leading independent member-driven external dispute resolution (EDR) organization for international online brokerages, exchanges, and Blockchain firms that participate in global foreign exchange (forex), derivatives, CFD, and digital asset markets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Financial Commission provides efficient compliance solutions to its members, alongside its External Dispute Resolution (EDR) mechanism that serves as an effective channel for processing complaints from clients of member firms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information please contact us at <\/span><a href=\"mailto:info@financialcommission.com.co\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">info@financialcommission.com.co<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>October 7th,\u00a0 2020, The Financial Commission announces its operating metrics for the month of September 2020 as part of its monthly Complaints Digest.
