At first glance, such tools offer investors an advantage in finding price movements or patterns to earn a profit, but the use of such trading tools often comes with increased risks for the investor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Such 3rd party automated trading tools are often referred to as robots, advisors, algorithms and the like. Popular trading platforms, such as MetaTrader have entire communities of traders and programmers who build so-called Expert Advisors &#8211; software that runs on the trading platform and conducts automated price analysis and trading.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other broker platforms may have similar software that works on top of the existing platform infrastructure to help investors automate their trading strategies and market analysis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both novice and experienced traders need to keep in mind that using such trading tools can present <\/span><strong>additional <\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">risks for investors apart from possible losses incurred while trading.

The latter is especially important in order to understand when and how the trading tool will be conducting trades for the user in a live environment. <\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to understand these details in order to analyze the amount of risk a trader is willing to tolerate when using 3rd party trading tools.
