The incident on the Client\u2019s accounts occurred on April 22, 2022, at 01:04 (GMT). At the specified time, due to expansion of the spread in the financial instrument XAUUSD, the Equity\/Margin ratio on the Client\u2019s accounts dropped below the critical level. As such, the Client\u2019s positions with the financial instrument XAUUSD established on trading accounts were liquidated by the Broker due to deficit of margin (Stop Out). The amount of the Client\u2019s losses incurred by the incident totaled 95605.20 HKD. After the incident the Broker offered compensation to the Client in the amount of 20000 HKD, as a gesture of goodwill.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Client is not satisfied with the Broker&#8217;s decision (see below), does not accept the compensation offered by the Broker, and requests the Dispute Resolution Committee to check the correctness of execution of the disputed transactions closed by Stop Out, as well as demands compensation of losses in the amount of 120000 HKD from the Broker. The Client provided investigation with the screenshot of tick data on the financial instrument XAUUSD in the period of the incident provided by the Broker, as well as the list of transactions liquidated by the Broker, as documentary evidence.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In turn, the Broker does not see any grounds for the Client&#8217;s complaint, since in their opinion all Client\u2019s positions were closed correctly, at actual market prices and in accordance with the provisions of the regulatory documents and trading rules established by the Company. The Broker provided investigation with the history of trading operations performed by the Client, the server log records, the history of ticks on the financial instrument XAUUSD in the period of the incident, as well as e-mail correspondence with the Client on this complaint, as documentary evidence.<\/span><\/p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Complainant<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Broker<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">XXX<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">YYY<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Financial Commission Complaint<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">#ZZZ<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Complaint Raising Date<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Complaint Filing Date<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">22\/04\/2022<\/span><\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">22\/05\/2022<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\"><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\"><strong>Complaint response:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The decision on this complaint is based on the information provided by the brokerage company and complainant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a comprehensive analysis of the documentary evidence provided by the Client and the Broker the Dispute Resolution Committee of the Financial Commission has come to the following conclusions:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First of all, it should be noted that incident on the Client\u2019s account occurred in the period of thin market: during rollovers market very often experiences significant decrease in liquidity. In turn, this circumstance radically changes the flow of quotes, leading to dramatic expansion of spreads and generating price gaps. The Client should be aware that trading in such market conditions is accompanied by significant risks.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, the Client should take into account that even 100% locking on trading accounts with a floating spread is impossible, due to the absence of a fixed difference between the Buy and Sell prices. In the case of position locking (which was the case in this case), spread widening automatically reduces the unrealized positive financial result on profitable positions, while increasing the unrealized negative financial result on unprofitable positions. In some market situations, spread widening can lead to undesirable consequences, such as Stop Out.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third, the trading terms for the Client\u2019s account suggest a floating spread and a Stop Out at 50% level. This information is clearly defined on the Broker\u2019s website. By opening a trading account of the selected type, the Client agreed to accept the trading terms provided by the Company. In this regard, it should be noted that according to the information received from the Broker, at the time of the incident, the Equity\/Margin ratio on the Client&#8217;s account dropped below 50% level due to widening of the spread in the financial instrument XAUUSD from several cents to more than 10 USD (at the time of market opening, 22.04.2022). As such, all Client\u2019s positions were closed automatically,\u00a0at prices available\u00a0on the market\u00a0(Stop Out). This fact is confirmed by the records from the server log, provided by the Broker. In the period of the incident the Broker acted in full compliance with the provisions of their <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Terms and conditions<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">15.11 The Company may (without notice to you) Close Out, but will not be obliged to Close Out or to attempt to Close Out, some or all Open Positions, at that time or any later time as we determine (whether in our discretion or by automatic trading platform management) if:\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(a) your Account Value falls below the Liquidation Level; or\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(b) you fail to maintain the required Margin Cover; or\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(c) at any time, and from time to time, the Company determines that the value of all of your Open Positions (and not taking into account any cash balance in your Account) represents a substantial net unrealized loss to you such that, in our belief, the continued trading, or failure to Close Out, one or more of your Open Positions will or is likely to materially prejudice your Account Value.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">15.12 Details of Margin amounts paid and owing by you are available by logging onto your Account.<\/span><\/i><i><\/i><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At last, to ensure an objective investigation of the case the DRC requested historical data on the financial instrument in the disputed transactions from other independent providers of financial services. Financial Commission uses several different sources, such as Tradeproofer, Tradefora, Verify My Trade, TrueFX, FX Benchmark and some others for the purpose of verification of the quality of trades\u2019 execution. In the general opinion of the DRC members, the financial result on the disputed transactions performed on the Client\u2019s accounts on the day of the incident, 22.04.2022, should be canceled by the Broker. Experts of the DRC have come to such a conclusion after a comparison of the Broker\u2019s quotes offered to the Client with the quotes received from other reliable sources. At the time of forced liquidation of the specified transactions, the quotes on the financial instrument XAUUSD in the Broker&#8217;s quotes feed differed significantly from the quotes received from other independent providers of financial services and, as such, did not reflect the actual situation on the market.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Summarizing all the above, the Resolution Committee of the Financial Commission has made a decision in favor of the Client and decided as follows:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Broker must cancel the financial results received by the Client in the disputed transactions performed on his trading accounts on the day of the incident, 22.04.2022.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To consider the actions of the Broker to forcibly liquidate the Client\u2019s disputed positions as unlawful.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Broker must restore the Client&#8217;s disputed positions closed as result of illegal liquidation.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This complaint was reviewed by the members of the Dispute Resolution Committee of the Financial Commission and was processed by the Head of the Committee.\u00a0<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Ruled in Favor<\/strong><\/td>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Compensation<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Client<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">None<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\">If you have any questions regarding this investigation, please send them to the following address info@financialcommission.org<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\"><strong>Acknowledgement<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\">I certify that all information was considered by the Dispute Resolution Committee of the Financial Commission and hereby confirm that the decision was made fairly, impartially and without interference.
