Planning for the future is crucial for any business leader, government official, or individual. Accurate information about the state of the world allows us to plan and coordinate our actions more effectively. Markets provide direct expressions of our unbiased expectations, with market prices reflecting the prevailing consensus. We can adjust our plans based on these forecasts or act on our disagreements to earn profits or hedge our exposures.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Simple and Intuitive Contracts on ForecastEx<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ForecastEx contracts are designed to establish consensus views on various issues and hedge economic exposure. The platform offers simple and intuitive contract listings:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if an investor believes the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) will rise above a specific value, they can buy a \u201cyes\u201d contract. Conversely, if they think the event will not happen, they can purchase a \u201cno\u201d contract. Contract prices range from $0.02 to $0.99, fluctuating based on market participants\u2019 judgments of probabilities. Upon event resolution (e.g., the US Bureau of Labor Statistics announcing the CPI), the contract settles at $1 for a correct contract and $0 for an incorrect one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Expansion to Global Issues<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ForecastEx contracts are available with weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual durations. Interactive Brokers will pay interest at 0.5% below the prevailing Fed Funds rate on the closing market value of positions, with income interest accruing daily and paid monthly, currently at a rate of 4.83% APR.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Available Contracts<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ForecastEx will initially offer contracts for the following indicators:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Economic:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; US Fed Funds Target Rate<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; US Consumer Sentiment<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; US Housing Starts<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; US Retail Sales<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; US Building Permits<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; US Consumer Price Index<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; US Payroll Employment<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; US Unemployment Rate<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; US Corporate Profits<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; US Initial Jobless Claims<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; US National Debt<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; US Real GDP<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Climate:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Global Temperature<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; US Temperature<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following its initial launch, ForecastEx plans to expand internationally and include additional local and controversial global issues.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has granted approval for ForecastEx LLC to operate as a contract market and derivative clearing organization.
