Ultimately, clients can choose not to receive such advisory services from their trading provider and can make their own determinations on investment objectives.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As before, broker members will be required to continue to adhere to the rules regarding voice disclosure record keeping requirements.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For more information regarding voice risk disclosure requirements please review the <a href=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/members\/membership-rules-and-guidelines\/\">Commission\u2019s Membership Rules and Guidelines<\/a> or contact us on <a href=\"mailto:info@financialcommission.org\">info@financialcommission.org<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>April 16, 2018, The Financial Commission, a leading independent member-driven external dispute resolution (EDR) organization for international online brokerages that participate in global foreign exchange (forex), derivatives, and cryptocurrency markets, announced the implementation of a new voice risk disclaimer (VRD) to be used by broker members in providing consulting or advisory services to their customers.
