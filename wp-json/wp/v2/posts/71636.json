Like in every field or industry, friction and disputes do arise, and up till now \u2013 it has often been a long and rigid process to reach resolutions and manage disputes. Moreover, there has always been a veil of mystery around these disputes, with resolutions not being found, or even sought. This is where Financial Commission comes into the picture.<\/p>\n<p><b>What the Financial Commission is all about<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Financial Commission is a neutral, third party dispute resolution entity in the field of Forex trading; solving disputes between traders and their brokers. A new player indeed, Financial Commission has filled a big vacuum of need in the industry. The Commission bases its philosophy on the following pillars:<\/p>\n<p><i>1. Education<\/i>. Knowledge is power. Oftentimes, disputes arise from a lack of knowledge or misunderstandings on the side of the traders, about how the Forex industry works. Slippage, pip spread, spikes and more could throw traders off track and cause them to believe there has been misconduct. Whether the dispute has arisen from a lack of knowledge or not, the disgruntled trader will in both cases feel acute lack of fairness. The Financial Commission has outlined its mission to give knowledge to the traders, so they are\u00a0<i>partners<\/i>\u00a0in their success, as opposed to mere onlookers, and never in the dark about how the industry works. On the other side of the same coin, Financial Commission educates its members on how to better communicate with their traders, in order to make the relationship a healthy two-way dialogue. For Financial Commission, education is of utmost importance due to its mission to deal with the\u00a0<i>root<\/i>\u00a0of the problems, rather than only providing on-the-spot solutions. This is the very philosophy that, for all parties involved, will transform our industry into a clearer and fairer one.<\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0<i>Transparency<\/i>. Having a neutral, professional and unaffiliated body you can trust in this tumultuous world of Forex can make all the difference. The interest-free Financial Commission and the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) that is built up of a fascinating mosaic of experienced and esteemed figures in the industry, work together to review each and every case with one goal only; dispute resolution on the side of justice. With the bigger picture always in the background of making this industry clearer and granting traders more knowledge, Financial Commission zooms in on any complaint that arises in order to make sure that the parties walk away with the knowledge they need about the case, as well as an amicable and fair resolution. The healthiest dispute resolution that exists is one where a neutral body is pre-defined and gears into operation to objectively solve a dispute when needed. In the world of Forex, Financial Commission is it.<\/p>\n<p>3.\u00a0<i>Swiftness and efficiency<\/i>. The Financial Commission with the DRC at the heart of its operation works like clockwork on each and every complaint. In concretely organized steps, the DRC will reach a resolution of the case within several weeks, with intermediary milestones of communication along the way, with both sides of the dispute. Alongside the dedication to education and reliability, Financial Commission believes in the highest level of professionalism and meticulous conduct in every endeavor, in order to continue its impressive track record for years to come.<\/p>\n<p><b><\/b><b>In Only Six Months, Impressive Results<\/b><\/p>\n<p>During only six months of operation, the Financial Commission has resolved around 20 complaints from traders; most of which were only in the last 2 months. Alongside this, we are pleased to know that the traders\u2019 community awareness regarding an independent arbitrator who can address their disputes against service providers in the financial markets has increased significantly. A remarkable fact is, that the bulk of claims are directly related to the most basic principles of Forex trading, which are still poorly understood by traders. This is purely in line with Financial Commission\u2019s overall philosophy of giving education a major role within dispute resolution. Among these are some aspects of trading, such as execution of pending orders during the publication of important economic news, the way the margin for open positions is calculated in all trading platforms or for example, the purpose and the operation principle of Stop Out or Margin Call. Some traders get a better understanding of these things too late, and very often their open positions are closed by the broker because of lack of free margin. In this regard, the Financial Commission recommends that the brokerage companies pay more attention to the education of their customers. All brokers must do so in order to help their customers avoid some unpleasant situations while trading.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to offering a dispute resolution framework and enhancing the education of the traders in order to reduce the overall number of disputes and grievances in the long run, the most important aspect of this mechanism, is that it helps the brokers to retain their critical mass of clientele. That is, due to the fact that many small traders never actually file complaints, but simply leave negative feedback in traders\u2019 forums and spread the word in their communities, (often stemming from lack of knowledge), brokers could slowly but surely lose a significant number of traders, who will simply wander elsewhere in these cases.<\/p>\n<p>Financial Commission also helps to expose new trends and phenomena that come up in the industry, based on the claims it receives. It is particularly interesting to note one category of claims, which included cases where clients of brokerage firms either intentionally or unknowingly used special software (Expert Advisors), which was designed to cheat, using trading technologies. The Financial Commission has taken a tough stance on this issue and believes that the use of such methods to generate profits is a violation of generally accepted norms and principles of doing business based on fair and mutually beneficial partnership. We feel it`s very important to mention here that Financial Commission may never be used as a bargaining tool for the traders who utilize such methods. The founders of the Financial Commission have repeatedly witnessed situations where a person using such techniques was identified and expelled from the ranks of customers of the affected companies. However, in some cases, such clients managed to withdraw some dishonest profits from their accounts. The official position of the Financial Commission on this issue is that on regulated markets such actions should be classified as fraud. Finally, we selected a specific category of claims related to failures in the technical provision of brokerage companies. Typically, such claims do not cause any problems and are resolved in favor of traders.<ins cite=\"mailto:Peter\" datetime=\"2014-02-03T14:46\"><\/ins><\/p>\n<p>Looking at the final statistics on claims admitted to the Financial Commission during the period of its existence, around 26% of the claims were resolved in favor of traders<del cite=\"mailto:user1\" datetime=\"2014-02-11T10:43\">\u00a0<\/del>.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the aforementioned claims, the Financial Commission has received 12 complaints from clients of brokerage firms, who are not yet members of our organization. The geographical span of these customers is very extensive; clients from Russia, other countries of Eastern Europe and the CIS, China and Southeast Asia, the Arab countries and more. This again reinforces that fact that the problem of lack of a fair dispute resolution mechanism, actually exists. We are communicating with brokerage companies from these regions and highly recommend to them to join the Financial Commission in order to further work together to solve these problems in a more efficient way. Finally, there is a mechanism to do so, which will be favorable for all.<\/p>\n<p><b>The Members of the Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Over the course of only six months, Financial Commission has already had the pleasure of welcoming <a title=\"Participating members of the Financial Commission\" href=\"http:\/\/xcv.financialcommission.org\/members\/participating-members-of-the-financial-commission\/\">seven of the biggest names of the industry<\/a> as members, and the activity of the Financial Commission is gaining speed, as this new and exciting mechanism is gaining its well-deserved place on the map.<\/p>\n<p>AForex, Alpari, FXOpen FXFair, Lionstone Investment<del cite=\"mailto:Peter\" datetime=\"2014-02-03T14:47\">\u00a0<\/del>,MFX Broker and RoboForex are among the recent members to join the Commission, many of which have already experienced successful and satisfactory dispute resolution.
