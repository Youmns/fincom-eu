Applicants who meet the requirements to become certified education providers will be listed on Financial Commission\u2019s official website.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Requirements for Education Provider Certification<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Applicants for the education provider certification service can apply on a voluntary basis and will have the opportunity to provide their educational materials for a comprehensive review by the Financial Commission Certification Board and submit a questionnaire for due diligence.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Financial Commission will review the content of the educational courses based on their accuracy, level of comprehension, balance of risk and reward, other measures of appropriateness, scope of trading strategies and other practices that are important when providing education to traders.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Education Content Evaluation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once the materials have been evaluated, the Financial Commission will issue a review to the applicant highlighting its findings and may recommend changes to the educational materials that could help traders more easily understand and learn the markets. In such cases, the provider will be given 15 business days to complete the amendments and provide to the Financial Commission for final review prior to certification.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Financial Commission will only issue approved certification if an applicant is able to demonstrate that all their educational materials meet the requirements that Financial Commission has requested and to a degree that satisfies Financial Commission\u2019s standards for education providers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Financial Commission Chairman, Peter Tatarnikov, said: \u201cAs the internet is increasingly saturated with online trading content from numerous sources, it becomes more difficult for traders to distinguish whether educational materials are genuine and balanced or merely disguised marketing content dressed as education. Financial Commission\u2019s new certification service helps ensure that education providers can better serve brokers and their end clients, by complying with a set of standards that helps uphold transparency, balanced and accurate content, and a self-regulatory approach to the entire educational process.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cWe are very pleased to announce the launch of the education provider certification service at Financial Commission, and welcome it into our growing suite certification services for Fintech companies catering to the global brokerage community.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Need For Best Practices with Trader\u2019s Educational Content<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Financial Commission fully supports the need for improving the quality of educational services offered by brokers, including by third parties, and encourages education providers to incorporate industry best practices. Financial Commission is ideally positioned to cater to the rising demand of firms offering educational services.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In order to initiate the Educational Offering Certification process, a firm can contact Financial Commission requesting such service and Financial Commission will send a certification agreement and a list of documents and materials required by the Financial Commission in order to evaluate the applicant for Educational certification.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>About Financial Commission<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Founded in 2013, Financial Commission is an industry-supported Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) whose members join on a voluntary basis, subject to approval and strict adherence to <a href=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/members\/membership-rules-and-guidelines\/\">membership rules<\/a>, to maintain good standing.
