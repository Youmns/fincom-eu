Numerous keynote speakers from the digital trading and investment community provided insights into the latest industry trends, challenges and solutions, including David Weild IV, former Vice Chairman of NASDAQ, Chairman, and CEO of Weild &amp; Co. Inc.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our representatives met in person with event delegates to discuss developing trends in blockchain and cryptocurrency technology, as well as regulatory efforts in the space. Likewise, during the event, we met with representatives of Blockchain technology companies to discuss common issues related to digital asset security and performance. Given the Commission\u2019s continuing goal of increasing transparency for the digital asset industry, our discussion focused on the Financial Commission Blockchain Association\u2019s efforts to provide free dispute resolution services to digital asset investors and traders.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Commenting on the event participation, Financial Commission Chairman, Peter Tatarnikov said, \u201cOur organization believes it is important for digital asset investors and traders to have access to a free independent 3rd party dispute resolution mechanism if they cannot settle a matter with their exchange or ewallet. It was important to attend the Next Block conference to help us communicate this message and highlight our new Blockchain Association as an example of self-regulatory efforts for digital assets and financial firms that transact on the blockchain. We look forward to future events both in Israel and elsewhere to interact with our professional and regulatory counterparts on improving conditions in these growing new markets.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>About Financial Commission<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Founded in 2013, the Financial Commission is a leading independent member-driven external dispute resolution (EDR) organization for international online brokerages that participate in global foreign exchange (forex), derivatives, and CFD markets.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Financial Commission provides efficient compliance solutions to its members, alongside its External Dispute Resolution (EDR) mechanism that serves as an effective channel for processing complaints from clients of member firms.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To find out how the Commission is expanding efforts into self-regulation and transparency for the digital currencies and Blockchain markets, please visit the<a href=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.org\/blockchain-association\/\"> Blockchain Association page<\/a> of our website.<\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>December 14th, \u00a02018, The Financial Commission today announces its successful participation at the Next Block conference hosted by Krypton Events, which took place at TASE &#8211; The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange Conference Center on Wednesday, December 12th. &nbsp; The event brought together over 350 industry professionals from the blockchain and cryptocurrency field.
