Steady numbers for filed and resolved complaints suggest traders are continuing to try and take advantage of market opportunities with the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) continuing to process a larger number of complaints than in the summer months. The DRC was able to award a larger amount of compensation to traders than in the previous month while experiencing a jump in the amounts sought by traders from broker members in October.\u00a0 At the same time, over 23% of all new complaints filed with the DRC in October were valued between $1,000-$10K+, highlighting the continued importance of the organization to investigate complaints with a significant monetary value. During the month, the DRC was able to resolve 8% fewer complaints than in September with some complaint investigations and decisions carrying over into November, while improving average resolution times, which still continue to outpace alternative EDR services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Financial Commission has conducted dispute resolution services specifically for FX and CFD traders and broker member firms since 2013 as an independent, non-governmental self-regulatory organization and external dispute resolution (EDR) forum.
