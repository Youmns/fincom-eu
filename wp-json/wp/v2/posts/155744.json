Specifically, the organization experienced a 5% drop in new complaints filed, while the total number of complaints resolved in the quarter fell slightly by 2%. At the same time, total complaints amounts sought and awarded and average complaint values all decreased by 48%, 82%, and 44% respectively. In complaint categories, financial-related complaints continued to dominate for 1Q 2025, while non-trading complaints fell by 26%. Complaints valued up to $100 jumped 22% during this period, while higher-value complaints in the $500-999 category grew by 14%.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the period, the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) resolved complaints slower than in the previous quarter, with 6.8 days in average dispute resolution time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Financial Commission is an independent external dispute resolution (EDR) organization for consumers\/traders who are unable to resolve disputes directly with their financial services providers who are members of the Financial Commission.
