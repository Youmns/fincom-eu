Asia-based broker GMO Click <a href=\"https:\/\/www.financemagnates.com\/forex\/brokers\/the-upside-of-covid-19-gmo-click-sees-record-march-fx-volumes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">has just announced a significant upswing<\/a> in trading volumes, while UK-based CMC markets <a href=\"https:\/\/www.financemagnates.com\/forex\/brokers\/cmc-markets-expects-solid-fy2020-revenues-boosted-by-covid-19\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">have reported updated revenue projections<\/a>, which indicate the broker\u2019s financial year is ending with improvement.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Having reported a healthy rise in trading volumes in February of 2020 of 27% month over month, GMO Click has now announced that their March trading volumes have exploded to nearly $1.84 trillion. This is a steep rise, as the previous month&#8217;s total was $728 billion. On an annualized basis this growth is more significant, as March of 2019 had an OTC FX margin trading volume of $607 billion. As such, the trading volumes increased a whopping 202.9% over last year\u2019s comparable period.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For its part, CMC Markets <a href=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.com.co\/2020\/03\/03\/cmc-reports-upbeat-revenue-forecast-for-fiscal-2020\/\">noted an increase in the trading activity<\/a> of its CFD business recently, as we reported. Today, the broker is seeing the benefits from this activity having recorded gross revenues of approximately \u00a3241 million for the 2020 financial year, which is over 11% higher than the 2019 financial year. Furthermore, the broker now expects net revenues to be approximately \u00a3214 million, which is almost double the \u00a3110.2 million achieved in 2019. The broker noted that the increased trading activity in the first three months of 2020 offset the reduction in activity that followed ESMA intervention measures in August of 2018.<\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread across the globe and financial markets continue to experience significant price movements, Forex and CFD brokers continue to report growth in trading volumes and, in most cases, improved revenue projects.
