Today the FCA published the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fca.org.uk\/publication\/impact-assessments\/restricting-contract-difference-products-sold-retail-clients.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">results of the assessment<\/a> which showed a reduction in net income for these two firms for the financial years 2019 \u2013 2021 is close to \u00a317 million per year on average. This represents a 6.7% decline in net income (around 6% for the first firm and 10% for the second).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since firms\u2019 business models differ, scaling up this loss of net revenue for the whole market will not yield a precise estimate of CFD firms\u2019 total loss of profit. In light of this, the FCA calculated lower and upper bounds for the estimates for the remaining CFD firms based on the expected decline in net income of 6% and 10% for these two firms. The corresponding reduction for all firms is therefore approximately \u00a338.5 million and \u00a355.3 million.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The restrictions introduced by the FCA go further than ESMA\u2019s by applying to a wider range of products by including CFD-like options, and limiting leverage for CFDs referencing certain government bonds to 30:1 (compared with 5:1 under ESMA\u2019s measures).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If the FCA estimates are accurate we believe that the impact on revenue specifically for Forex and CFD brokers domiciled in the UK is significant when comparing the losses to the overall annual revenue that is reported by some brokers.
