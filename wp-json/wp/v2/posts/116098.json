Notably, during the same period several key metrics, including average complaints value, amounts sought by traders and complaints categories suggest that cases reviewed by the DRC in August were more complex in substance and valuable than previous months in a shift of \u201cquantity vs. quality\u201d. The financial-related complaints category continued to dominate, indicating that traders are dealing increasingly with issues related to funds withdrawal, rather than trading, as witnessed in previous months. With the decrease in new filed complaints, the DRC was able to achieve its most remarkable average resolution times, coming in at just 4.6 days in August.<\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Founded in 2013, the Financial Commission is a leading independent member-driven external dispute resolution (EDR) organization for international online brokerages, exchanges and Blockchain firms that participate in global foreign exchange (forex), derivatives, CFD and digital asset markets.<\/p>\n<p>The Financial Commission provides efficient compliance solutions to its members, alongside its External Dispute Resolution (EDR) mechanism that serves as an effective channel for processing complaints from clients of member firms.<\/p>\n<p>For more information please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:info@financialcommission.org\">info@financialcommission.org<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>September 7th,\u00a0 2020, The Financial Commission announces its operating metrics for the month of August 2020 as part of its monthly Complaints Digest.
