Before the incident, the Client established several positions (Long and Short) with different financial instruments on the specified account.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, by the time of the incident:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The total volume of Long positions in the financial instrument XAUUSD was equal to 8 lots;<\/li>\n<li>The total volume of Short positions in the financial instrument NSD was equal to 4 lots;<\/li>\n<li>The total volume of Long positions in the financial instrument WTI was equal to 2 lots;<\/li>\n<li>The total volume of Short positions in the financial instrument CHFJPY was equal to 1 lot;<\/li>\n<li>The total volume of Short positions in the financial instrument GBPCAD was equal to 11 lots.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The incident on the Client\u2019s account occurred on November 13, 2023, at 01:30:19 (server time, UTC+2). At the specified time, due to the unfavourable change in the price of the financial instrument XAUUSD the Equity\/Margin ratio on the Client\u2019s account fell below the critical level. Therefore, the Client\u2019s positions ## 30202517, 30350840, 30542914, 30851355, 30887570, and 30905531, were liquidated by the Broker due to lack of Margin (Stop Out). The total amount of the Client\u2019s financial losses was 3165.81 USD.<\/p>\n<p>Following the incident, the Broker admitted that during the period of the incident, the Company experienced a pricing error, that led to the erroneous closing of the Client\u2019s positions. According to the Broker, the incorrect quote (1920.96) for the financial instrument XAUUSD was received from one of its liquidity providers at the close of the Client\u2019s trades, and the disputed positions were closed incorrectly. Therefore, the Broker apologized to the Client for the inconvenience caused by the pricing error and offered him compensation in the amount of 1314.40 USD.<\/p>\n<p>The Client is not satisfied with the Broker\u2019s decision on this complaint (see below), holds the Broker responsible for the financial losses that occurred on trading account # XXX and believes that the liquidated positions could have been closed with much higher profits if not for the pricing error on the Broker\u2019s platform, as the price of the financial instrument XAUUSD reached all-time highs in a few days after the incident. Therefore, the Client rejects the compensation offered by the Broker and requests the Dispute Resolution Committee of the Financial Commission to verify the correctness of the Broker\u2019s actions during and after the incident. In the Client\u2019s opinion, a fair resolution of the dispute would be for the Broker to reinstate the disputed positions at the same prices or to calculate the accrued profits from the price difference between the previous price and the actual current price and deposit it into his account. The Client has provided the investigation with the screenshots showing the email communications with Broker regarding this incident, as documentary evidence.<\/p>\n<p>In turn, the Broker does not see any grounds for the Client&#8217;s complaint, since in their opinion, they acted in full compliance with the provisions of their regulatory documents and trading rules established by the Company. The Broker has provided the investigation with the official response to the Client\u2019s complaint, the history of the Client\u2019s trading \/non-trading operations, as well as the history of quotes on the financial instrument XAUUSD and the server log records in the period of the incident, as documentary evidence.<\/p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Complainant<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Broker<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">XXX<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">YYY<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Financial Commission Complaint<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">#ZZZ<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Complaint Raising Date<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Complaint Filing Date<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">04\/12\/2023<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">14\/12\/2023<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\"><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\"><strong>Complaint Response:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The decision on this complaint is based on the information provided by the brokerage company XXXXX and Mr. XXXXX.<\/p>\n<p>After a comprehensive analysis of the documentary evidence provided by the Client and the Broker the Dispute Resolution Committee of the Financial Commission has come to the following conclusions:<\/p>\n<p>1. First of all, it should be noted that according to the information received from the Broker:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">a) On 13.11.2023 at 01:30:19 a non-market quote from one of the liquidity providers (1920.96) entered the price flow for the financial instrument XAUUSD.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">b) As a result of the pricing incident the Client\u2019s positions ## 30202517, 30350840, 30542914, 30851355, 30887570, 30905531 were forcibly closed by Stop Out.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\u0441) The Broker has credited the Client\u2019s account with the compensation in the amount of 1314.40 The fact of compensation is confirmed by 1 balance sheet transaction # 28694941.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">d) The amount of compensation was calculated by the Broker as the difference between the actual closing price (1920.96) of the disputed Long positions ## 30202517, 30542914, 30851355, 30905531 and the actual market price (1937.39) available at the moment of the Stop Out event, that occurred at 01:30:19 (server time).<\/p>\n<p>In support of their position the Broker referred to the following provisions of the Regulations on trading operations for MT5 accounts:<\/p>\n<p><em>9.21<\/em> <em>In<\/em> <em>the<\/em> <em>event<\/em> <em>of<\/em> <em>a<\/em> <em>spike<\/em> <em>(error<\/em> <em>quote) \u2013<\/em> <em>when<\/em> <em>a<\/em> <em>non-market<\/em> <em>quote<\/em> <em>enters<\/em> <em>the<\/em> <em>quotes<\/em> <em>flow<\/em> <em>(a<\/em> <em>non-market<\/em> <em>quote means<\/em> <em>the<\/em> <em>following:<\/em> <em>a<\/em> <em>price<\/em> <em>in<\/em> <em>the<\/em> <em>trading<\/em> <em>platform<\/em> <em>that<\/em> <em>does<\/em> <em>not<\/em> <em>correspond<\/em> <em>to<\/em> <em>the<\/em> <em>market<\/em> <em>price<\/em> <em>at<\/em> <em>a<\/em> <em>given<\/em> <em>period <\/em><em>of<\/em><em> time; there is a significant price gap; the price returns to its initial position within a short period with a price gap <\/em><em>being formed; the absence of extreme price fluctuations preceding the formation of this quotation; the absence of <\/em><em>significant macroeconomic events and\/or high-impact corporate news at the time of its occurrence), the Company <\/em><em>shall<\/em> <em>be liable for<\/em> <em>any<\/em> <em>losses<\/em> <em>incurred as<\/em> <em>a result<\/em> <em>of<\/em> <em>trading operations<\/em> <em>performed at this<\/em> <em>non-market quote,<\/em> <em>ie<\/em> <em>the Client<\/em> <em>will<\/em> <em>be<\/em> <em>fully reimbursed for<\/em> <em>the<\/em> <em>loss<\/em> <em>received<\/em> <em>due<\/em> <em>to<\/em> <em>a<\/em> <em>non-market<\/em> <em>quote.<\/em> <em>The<\/em> <em>profit<\/em> <em>received<\/em> <em>from<\/em> <em>a<\/em> <em>non- <\/em><em>market<\/em> <em>quote<\/em> <em>will<\/em> <em>be<\/em> <em>fully<\/em> <em>deducted<\/em> <em>from<\/em> <em>the<\/em> <em>Client\u2019s<\/em> <em>trading<\/em> <em>account.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>2. Second, with regard to the unrealized profits on the disputed positions established with the financial instrument XAUUSD, which the Client claims were missed due to the pricing error on the Broker\u2019s side, the following should be noted:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">a) According to the documentary evidence provided by the Broker (full trading statement, server log records), the Client did not attach any pending Take Profit \/ Stop Loss orders to the disputed positions ## 30542914, In other words, the Client did not in any way indicate his intentions with respect to the relevant positions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">b) The same is true for the liquidated positions ## 30350840, 30887570 established with the financial instrument Nasdaq100.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\u0441) At the same time the disputed positions ## 30202517, 30851355 established with the financial instrument XAUUSD were supposed to be closed with profits at the price levels of 2011.62 and 25 indicated by the Client in the relevant Take Profit orders attached to said positions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">d) Thus, in the absence of the pricing error in the Broker\u2019s platform, the Client\u2019s positions ## 30202517, 30851355 would have been closed with profits in a few days after the incident, as the price of the financial instrument XAUUSD had reached its all-time high, but the rest of the disputed positions with no TP and SL orders attached to them (i.e. positions ## 30542914, 30905531, 30350840, 30887570) would have continued to generate profits\/losses.<\/p>\n<p>3. Third, to ensure an objective investigation of the case the DRC requested historical price data on the financial instrument in the disputed transactions from other independent providers of financial Financial Commission uses several different sources, such as Tradeproofer, Tradefora, Verify My Trade, TrueFX, FX Benchmark and some others for the purpose of verification of the quality of trades\u2019 execution. The comparison of the Broker\u2019s quotes offered to the Client with the quotes received from independent sources confirmed the fact that at the time of the incident (13.11.2023, at 01:30:19, server time) the Bid quote (1937.39) for the financial instrument XAUUSD, used by the Broker to calculate the amount of compensation, reflected the actual situation on the market.<\/p>\n<p>4. Finally, it should be noted that the members of the DRC took into account the following circumstances in reaching their decision on this complaint:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">a) The members of the DRC admitted that the pricing error in the Broker\u2019s platform disrupted the Client\u2019s trading plans and that this event had a negative impact on the Client\u2019s psychological state.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">b) Considering the above, it should be noted that the Financial Commission is committed to the best business practices accepted throughout the industry, which assumes that if there is any problem caused by the broker, there should be minimum impact on the Client, and some solutions should be provided in a quick manner to mitigate negative effects of it on the Client&#8217;s positions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">c) The Broker partially compensated the Client for unrealized profits and losses that could have been avoided due to the system failure. Thus, in the general opinion of DRC experts, the Broker acted correctly, but the amount of compensation offered to the Client was not considered appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>Summarizing all the above the Dispute Resolution Committee has ruled in favor of the Client. Considering the circumstances of the case, as well as the documentary evidence provided by both parties of the dispute, the experts of the DRC have found the actions of the Broker in the period of the incident as correct and legitimate. At the same time, the experts of the DRC have decided that the Client should be paid additional compensation in the amount of unrealized profits for the disputed orders ## 30202517, 30851355, taking into account the Client&#8217;s intentions in relation to the said orders, as well as the price dynamics of the financial instrument XAUUSD that occurred after the incident.<\/p>\n<p><em>This complaint was reviewed by the members of the Dispute Resolution Committee of the Financial Commission and was processed by the Head of the Committee.<\/em><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Ruled in Favor<\/strong><\/td>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Compensation<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Client<\/td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">1638.10 USD<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\">If you have any questions regarding this investigation, please send them to the following address info@financialcommission.org<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\"><strong>Acknowledgement<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\">I certify that all information was considered by the Dispute Resolution Committee of the Financial Commission and hereby confirm that the decision was made fairly, impartially and without interference.
