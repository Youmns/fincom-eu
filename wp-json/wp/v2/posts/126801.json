A decrease in newly filed complaints and increases in resolved complaints suggest traders may be taking advantage of the warmer summer months in light of the negative impact to such asset classes as digital currencies. Nonetheless, the Dispute Resolution Committee continues to receive and process a significant amount of complaints as compared to previous periods in 2021 and earlier. In 2Q 2022 the DRC was able to award a larger amount of compensation to traders than in the previous quarter while experiencing a jump in the amounts sought by traders from non-member brokers during this time. At the same time, the total amounts sought from broker members decreased, including a lower value of such complaints for the quarter.\u00a0 There was little change in the complaints topics for the period, with financial and non-trading complaints accounting for 24% and 64% of all new complaints for the period. Complaints listed in the value category $500-$1K jumped 17%, highlighting the continued importance of the organization to investigate complaints with varying monetary values. During the quarter, the DRC was able to resolve complaints more efficiently than in the previous period with less complaint investigations and decisions carrying over into 3Q 2022, while improving already exceptional average resolution times, which still continue to outpace alternative EDR services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Financial Commission has conducted dispute resolution services specifically for FX and CFD traders and broker member firms since 2013 as an independent, non-governmental self-regulatory organization and external dispute resolution (EDR) forum.
