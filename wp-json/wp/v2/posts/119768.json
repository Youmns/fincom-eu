Nonetheless, compensation amounts sought by traders, as well as average complaints values and the awards to traders in February 2021 by the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) highlight a persistent demand for EDR services. Financial-related complaints were beaten out by non-trading complaints in February, suggesting investors are having more issues with such things as bonus policies, account blocking and customer service-related issues. During the month, the DRC was able to maintain a steady rate of total resolved complaints, down just 8% from January 2021 and in doing so resolved complaints at a speed of 8.3 days, albeit increasing this metric 46% MoM, but still keeping it well below other comparable dispute resolution services available to traders.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Founded in 2013, the Financial Commission is a leading independent member-driven external dispute resolution (EDR) organization for international online brokerages, exchanges and Blockchain firms that participate in global foreign exchange (forex), derivatives, CFD and digital asset markets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Financial Commission provides efficient compliance solutions to its members, alongside its External Dispute Resolution (EDR) mechanism that serves as an effective channel for processing complaints from clients of member firms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information please contact us at <\/span><a href=\"mailto:info@financialcommission.org\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">info@financialcommission.org<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>March 9th 2021, The Financial Commission announces increased amounts sought and awarded to traders, as well as average complaints values for February 2021 as part of its monthly Complaints Digest.
