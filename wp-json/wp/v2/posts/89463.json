Together with other members of the panel, including representatives from the Association of Forex Dealers (AFD), the sole accredited SRO uniting all licensed Forex brokers in Russia, the Central Bank of Russia, National Bank of Belarus and the State Duma of the Russian Federation, Peter elaborated on effective dispute resolution process established by the Financial Commission with getting huge popularity around the globe, as well as commented on proposed changes to Russian FX legislation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The panel also reviewed proposed changes to maximum leverage allowed for retail FX trading in the country, including its benefits and shortfalls. Participants agreed that lowering leverage along with expanding the available product set is a reasonable compromise at this early stage of development of the regulated Russian FX market. An important topic of discussion came from the panel audience regarding the issue of Russian FX traders still preferring to open accounts in offshore jurisdictions due to the favorable trading conditions available in other countries. On this issue, the panel voiced different points of view, though a consensus was reached that the regulated FX market in Russia must become competitive in order to attract domestic investors.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Financial Commission continues its autumn conference schedule in November with participation at the Magnates London Summit in London on November 13-14th.
