Traders have returned to global markets in healthy numbers and the increased trader activity in global markets, including equities and Contracts for Difference (DRC) has supported the demand for dispute resolution services, as highlighted by the improvements in several key metrics, including total amounts sought, average complaints values and non-member compensation sought. While financial-related complaints continued to dominate, trading related complaints accounted for 22%, suggesting investors are back to finding trading opportunities following recent market uncertainties. At the same time, the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) was able to rule a significantly higher number of complaints in favor of brokers in November, as a large number of complex disputes remained unresolved at the end of the November statistical period.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>About Financial Commission<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Founded in 2013, the Financial Commission is a leading independent member-driven external dispute resolution (EDR) organization for international online brokerages, exchanges, and Blockchain firms that participate in global foreign exchange (forex), derivatives, CFD, and digital asset markets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Financial Commission provides efficient compliance solutions to its members, alongside its External Dispute Resolution (EDR) mechanism that serves as an effective channel for processing complaints from clients of member firms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information please contact us at <\/span><a href=\"mailto:info@financialcommission.com.co\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">info@financialcommission.com.co<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>December 15th,\u00a0 2020, The Financial Commission announces a steady rise in values of submitted complaints, as well as compensation sought from traders for the month of November 2020 as part of its monthly Complaints Digest.
