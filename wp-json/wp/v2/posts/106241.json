In general, the amount of complaints received is not alarming, but one must consider that the data is presented for the last 6 months of 2019 and not the full year and no details are provided on the resolutions of such cases, which can in some situations require prolonged work on resolutions between the parties.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.com.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/fx_inside_afca.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-106251 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.com.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/fx_inside_afca.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"204\" srcset=\"https:\/\/financialcommission.com.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/fx_inside_afca.png 1000w, https:\/\/financialcommission.com.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/fx_inside_afca-300x61.png 300w, https:\/\/financialcommission.com.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/fx_inside_afca-768x157.png 768w, https:\/\/financialcommission.com.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/fx_inside_afca-200x41.png 200w, https:\/\/financialcommission.com.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/fx_inside_afca-400x82.png 400w, https:\/\/financialcommission.com.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/fx_inside_afca-600x122.png 600w, https:\/\/financialcommission.com.co\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/fx_inside_afca-800x163.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Considering the costs for brokers associated with filing and resolving complaints at AFCA, and the annual membership fees that are derived in part by complaints received and processed in previous periods, we believe further clarification is needed to determine the full costs to brokers in such matters.
