Examples of situations when a Complaint may be denied are as follows:<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">\u2013 the Complainant is known to the Financial Commission or in the Financial Services Industry in general as an untrustworthy person or a person who utilizes unfair or fraudulent practices in order to obtain gain from the Members;<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">\u2013 the Complainant has previously abused the procedures of the Financial Commission for the purpose, which the Financial Commission finds (in its sole discretion) improper;<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">\u2013 the Complainant has violated any of the Rules; and<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">\u2013 it came to the knowledge of the Financial Commission that the Complainant engages in disparaging acts (including, but not limited to statements in public forums) in relation to the Financial Commission, its directors, members of DRC and ICC, officers and employees.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">16 A.2 For the avoidance of doubt, the above examples are simply examples and the Financial Commission at its sole discretion may deny a Complaint on any other ground. The Financial Commission does not need to state the ground for denial (but may do so if it chooses so) when informing the Complainant that his\/her Complaint was rejected.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-toggle-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h6 id=\"elementor-tab-title-12018\" class=\"elementor-tab-title\" data-tab=\"18\" role=\"button\" aria-controls=\"elementor-tab-content-12018\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon elementor-toggle-icon-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-closed\"><i class=\"fas fa-plus\"><\/i><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-opened\"><i class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-opened fas fa-minus\"><\/i><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"elementor-toggle-title\" tabindex=\"0\">17.
