                complaints from traders amid the winter holiday break, demand
                for external dispute resolution (EDR) remains steady, while
                continued efforts to improve customer satisfaction at member
                firms attributed to the decrease in traders requiring EDR
                services. Specifically, the organization experienced a 5% drop
                in new complaints filed, while the total number of complaints
                resolved in the quarter fell slightly by 2%. At the same time,
                total complaints amounts sought and awarded and average
                complaint values all decreased by 48%, 82%, and 44%
                respectively. In complaint categories, financial-related
                complaints continued to dominate for 1Q 2025, while non-trading
                complaints fell by 26%. Complaints valued up to $100 jumped 22%
                during this period, while higher-value complaints in the
                $500-999 category grew by 14%. </span

              Commission took effect on March 12th, 2025, following the approval
              of its membership application by the Financial Commission, thus
              allowing the company and its customers access to a wide range of
              services and membership benefits including, but not limited to,
              protection for up to €20,000 per the submitted complaint, backed

              The Financial Commission provides brokerages and their customers
              with an unbiased 3rd party mediation platform that helps resolve
              complaints in instances when parties are unable to directly come
              to an agreement over disputes.

              For approved members and their clients participating in CFDs,

              Financial Commission helps facilitate a simpler, swifter
              resolution process than through typical regulatory channels such
              as arbitration or local court systems.

                quick and efficient dispute resolution services for traders and
                broker members in 2024. Shifting demand for safe-haven assets,
                such as gold, and continued geopolitical uncertainty provided
                for continued interest in online trading, leading to an increase
                in the share of trading-related complaints for 2024.
                Improvements in streamlining complaints submission processes
                with broker members led to a decrease of 32% in overall
                complaints filed during the year with the share of non-trading
                complaints falling 7% year over year, helping traders get their

                >The majority of complaints in 2024 were related to financial
                issues with 54% of the total, while trading-related disputes
                accounted for 24% and non-trading-related complaints 22%. The
                most popular topics for complaints dealt with funds withdrawal
                (47%), account block (19%), price check (8%), platform issues
                (5%), and stop-out orders (3%). Of all resolved complaints, 27%
                were resolved “in favor of the broker”, 11% were resolved “in
                favor of the client”, and 62% were found to be outside the
                organization’s jurisdiction. The share of complaints resolved in
                favor of traders in 2024 was approximately the same as in the
                previous year.</span
