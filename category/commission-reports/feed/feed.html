                complaints from traders amid the winter holiday break, demand
                for external dispute resolution (EDR) remains steady, while
                continued efforts to improve customer satisfaction at member
                firms attributed to the decrease in traders requiring EDR
                services. Specifically, the organization experienced a 5% drop
                in new complaints filed, while the total number of complaints
                resolved in the quarter fell slightly by 2%. At the same time,
                total complaints amounts sought and awarded and average
                complaint values all decreased by 48%, 82%, and 44%
                respectively. In complaint categories, financial-related
                complaints continued to dominate for 1Q 2025, while non-trading
                complaints fell by 26%. Complaints valued up to $100 jumped 22%
                during this period, while higher-value complaints in the
                $500-999 category grew by 14%. </span

                quick and efficient dispute resolution services for traders and
                broker members in 2024. Shifting demand for safe-haven assets,
                such as gold, and continued geopolitical uncertainty provided
                for continued interest in online trading, leading to an increase
                in the share of trading-related complaints for 2024.
                Improvements in streamlining complaints submission processes
                with broker members led to a decrease of 32% in overall
                complaints filed during the year with the share of non-trading
                complaints falling 7% year over year, helping traders get their

              experienced a 7% drop in new complaints filed, while the total
              number of complaints resolved in the quarter grew by 3%. In
              addition, complaints amounts sought and awarded and average
              complaint values decreased. In complaint categories,
              financial-related complaints jumped 11% from the previous quarter.
              Complaints valued at $500-$9,999 also jumped 37% during this
              period. A significant uptick was also witnessed for non-member
              complaints, which rose 25% Q/Q.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the period, the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) managed
              to shorten the average dispute resolution time by 8% for efficient
              complaints handling in just over 5 business days.

                range-bound price volatility and high-interest rates.
                Specifically, the organization experienced virtually no material

                resolved during the previous quarter. In this regard, the total
                amounts sought from traders equaled $4.4M for the quarter, 66%
                lower than 2Q 2023. At the same time, amounts awarded to traders
                experienced a significant jump to $331,809. Complaints with
                higher values also experienced significant increases, with
                complaints valued between $1K-10K jumping 141% QoQ and those

                hikes, and inflation globally possibly curtailed retail trading
                among investors in the second quarter of 2023 and led to changes
                in several key metrics of The Financial Commission.
                Specifically, the organization experienced a 3% slowdown QoQ in
                new complaints filed, as well as a 7% drop in the total number
                of complaints resolved in the quarter. Nonetheless, complaints
                amounts sought and awarded, as well average complaint values
                soared to significantly high levels. While some of the
                statistics were impacted by several large HNW complaints, the
                overall increases indicate that complaints submitted to The
