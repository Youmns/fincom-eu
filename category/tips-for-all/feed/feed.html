        ><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automation tools for
        conducting trading on financial markets have existed for many years and
        have become quite popular with retail investors around the world. At
        first glance, such tools offer investors an advantage in finding price
        movements or patterns to earn a profit, but the use of such trading
        tools often comes with increased risks for the investor.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such 3rd party automated trading
        tools are often referred to as robots, advisors, algorithms and the
        like. Popular trading platforms, such as MetaTrader have entire
        communities of traders and programmers who build so-called Expert
        Advisors &#8211; software that runs on the trading platform and conducts
        automated price analysis and trading. </span></p> <p><span
        style="font-weight: 400;">Other broker platforms may have similar
        software that works on top of the existing platform infrastructure to
        help investors automate their trading strategies and market
        analysis.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both novice and
        experienced traders need to keep in mind that using such trading tools
        can present </span><strong>additional </strong><span style="font-weight:
        400;">risks for investors apart from possible losses incurred while
        trading. We cover some of these risks below.</span><b></b></p> <ul> <li
        aria-level="1"><b>Not all 3rd party trading tools are created
        equal </b></li> </ul> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders should
        carefully consider the methodology used by trading tools that are
        offered by brokers or 3rd parties to make sure they align with the
        investor&#8217;s trading goals, risk appetite and frequency of trading.
        </span><strong>For example, you should carefully study how the trading
        tool you want to use analyzes market data, finds trade scenarios and how
        it executes orders on your behalf on the trading platform. The latter is
        especially important in order to understand when and how the trading
        tool will be conducting trades for the user in a live environment.
        </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><i><span
        style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to understand these details in
        order to analyze the amount of risk a trader is willing to tolerate when
        using 3rd party trading tools. Furthermore, the trader is responsible
        for understanding any settings or set up instructions required for the
        trading tools prior to using them in a live market.</span></i><br />
        <b></b></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Trading results achieved by 3rd
        party tools are the sole responsibility of the investor</b></li> </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traders must also understand that any
        profits or, more importantly, losses incurred on their account while
        using 3rd party trading tools are their sole responsibility.
        </span><strong>Most brokers will include clauses in the agreements
        governing retail client accounts absolving them of any legal
        responsibilities for trades or analysis conducted using such
        tools.</strong> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before beginning to
        use a 3rd party trading tool, carefully consider your risk appetite and
        the funds you are willing to lose, should the trading tool not work in
        your favour.</span></i><b></b></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Disputes
        involving losses incurred from the use of 3rd party trading
        tools  </b></li> </ul> <p><strong>Investors must understand that the
        resolution of disputes involving losses incurred from the use of
        automated trading tools often rests on the legally binding agreements
        between traders and their brokers. </strong><span style="font-weight:
        400;">As mentioned above, such agreements almost always indicate that
        any trading results achieved using such tools are the responsibility of
        the trader.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore,
        according to the Financial Commission’s </span><a
        href="../../../members/membership-rules-and-guidelines/membership-rules-and-guidelines.html"><span
        style="font-weight: 400;">Rules &amp; Guidelines</span></a>,<span
        style="font-weight: 400;"> such disputes may be rejected by the
        organization, in cases where losses incurred by the trader were the
        result of using tools provided by 3rd party companies or trader
        communities and not directly by a broker member of the Financial
        Commission.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given all
        these factors, </span><i><span style="font-weight:
        400;"><a href="/traders-education/traders-education.html" target="_blank">
<span class="elementor-icon-list-text">Traders</span>></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">must
        carefully consider if any 3rd party trading tools or software align with
        their trading strategy </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">given
        the risks described above and the low probability of achieving success
        in any type of dispute that may arise from such automated
        trading. </span></p> ]]></content:encoded

        statistics from the world’s major financial regulators, investors and
        traders are becoming victims of financial fraud and scams on a large
        scale. Oftentimes people are approached by unknown persons offering
        investment advice and promising hefty returns, while other times folks
        react to an advertisement and stumble upon websites offering investment
        or managed trading services and promising similar high profits. In order
        to avoid becoming a victim of financial scams, we’ve put together the
        following guide to help you stay protected and make informed investment
        decisions.</p> <p><b>Social Media</b></p> <p>Many fraudulent investment
        schemes will use social media to target prospective victims. Many times
        social media users will be approached by an unknown individual offering
        them investment advice and services. Other times a friend may recommend
        someone they met online that has offered good investment returns. Such
        individuals will claim to be knowledgeable or professional money
        managers, or investors themselves and may provide records of past
        investments to justify their services. Likewise, such individuals will
        most often offer the potential investor to open an account at a
        brokerage or investment firm.</p> <p>If someone approaches you through
        social media offering investment or managed trading services, always
        keep in mind that offering such services requires a license in most
        countries around the world from an official government regulator, such
        as FINRA in the United States, FCA in the United Kingdom and ASIC in
        Australia. If an individual provides you a copy of such a license, make
        sure to visit the website of the regulator and check that the license is
        valid (not revoked, suspended, terminated or fake).</p> <p>If the
        individual is asking you to open a trading or investment account at a
        financial firm, ask the individual to provide proof of their affiliation
        with this company &#8211; are they an employee, an introducing agent or
        an affiliated party? If the person cannot verify their relationship with
        the financial firm, it is possible they may not be acting in your best
        interests. Be sure to search the individuals’ name and company name in a
        search engine to find any possible reviews or feedback about the parties
        from other investors, regulators or associations. Negative feedback
        relating to loss or theft of funds from previous investors or financial
        regulators is a warning sign.   Likewise, it is important to study the
        website of the company for information that is required to be disclosed
        by regulators. For more on this topic, see the next section of our
        Guide.</p> <p><i>REMEMBER:</i></p> <ul> <li><i>Any solicitation for
        investment or managed trading of your funds through social media, such
        As Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, etc. should be treated with extreme
        caution</i></li> </ul> <ul> <li><em>Genuine solicitation of funds can
        only come from a licensed individual &#8211; make sure to ask for such
        licensing information if you are interested in the services being
        offered and confirm the information using a regulator’s
        website</em></li> </ul> <ul> <li><em>Investing funds with a 3rd party
        trader or money manager always involves risk of loss and thus no
        guarantee of success can ever be made or claimed</em></li> </ul> <ul>
        <li><em>Never sends funds to an individual for the purpose of then
        depositing those funds at a financial services company on your
        behalf</em></li> </ul> <ul> <li><em>Do not send funds to any company
        unless you fully understand the risks, including risks of trading or
        investing in financial instruments online or permitting someone to
        conduct these activities on your behalf</em></li> </ul> <ul> <li><em>If
        you are approached by a so-called investment advisor or money manager
        online or a friend or relative recommends such a person to you that they
        met online, we recommend that you double-check or triple-check all the
        information that is presented to you before making any decision to
        invest or trade</em></li> </ul> <p><b>How to Spot a Scam Website</b></p>
        <p>Besides being solicited online people can stumble upon or react to a
        marketing message from a company offering investment or managed trading
        services through an online website. Investors or prospective traders
        should use caution before making a decision to open an account or send
        their funds to such websites. It is important to first study the website
        and make sure that it contains some key information that helps
        differentiate legitimate companies from possible scams.</p> <p><i>Here’s
        what investors should ask themselves when analyzing an investment
        service website:</i></p> <ul> <li><i>Does the company provide a physical
        office address and telephone for contact? Can the address be verified in
        Google Maps? Does the country listed in the address match the country of
        the contact phone number provided?</i></li> </ul> <ul> <li><em>Can the
        company name, address and contact information easily be copied and
        pasted from the website using standard computer commands in an Internet
        browser?</em></li> </ul> <ul> <li><em>Does the website contain a
        comprehensive risk disclaimer at the bottom of their website regarding
        risks associated with investing or authorizing someone to trade funds on
        your behalf? Are risk disclaimers provided elsewhere as well?</em></li>
        </ul> <ul> <li><em>Does the name and address of the company listed on
        the website match the information listed in the Terms &amp; Conditions
        or Customer Agreement provided by the company?</em></li> </ul> <p>If you
        answered “no” to any of these questions while studying a website
        offering investment services it is possible that the website
        <i>could</i> be a scam. To make sure that company registration and
        contact information are genuine, you can contact the company at their
        phone, chat or email to get a response. Likewise, using an online map
        service can help determine if the address listed does indeed represent a
        building with offices or other structure typically used for business
        purposes.</p> <p><b>Funds Withdrawal Policies</b></p> <p>Another way to
        evaluate the risks of making an investment with a particular financial
        services company is to study their policies regarding the withdrawal of
        customer funds. Most if not all reputable companies will let a customer
        withdraw their funds from an investment or trading account almost
        immediately during normal business hours or within one or two business
        days without any preconditions. Furthermore, the customer is usually
        notified electronically as the withdrawal process is completed.</p>
        <p>If you find that the company you are interested to invest with or
        send funds to has a policy that requires you to either make an
        additional deposit, pay some form of tax or a percentage of your
        withdrawal amount in order to process the transaction of returning your
        funds to you, then it is possible it <i>could </i>be a scam.</p> <p>It
        is important to understand such details before opening an account or
        sending funds to the company, as it is very difficult to try and recover
        funds once they have been credited to the company or website in
        question.</p> <p><i>REMEMBER:</i></p> <ul> <li><i>Withdrawals from
        reputable companies most often do not take more than a few business days
        to be processed and you should expect to be notified of when your funds
        are sent back to you</i></li> </ul> <ul> <li><em>The company should not
        have any policies that would require you to have to deposit additional
        funds, pay a tax or percentage of your withdrawal amount in order to get
        your original funds back</em></li> <li><em>Make sure to check these
        policies before opening or funding an account</em></li> </ul> <p>If you
        have additional questions or doubts about an investment or managed
        trading opportunity you can rely on some additional online resources for
        help. You can check our organization’s <a
        href="../../../warning-list.html">Warning List</a> and <a
        href="../../../check-your-broker.html">Check Your Broker</a> directory
        to find out more information on known scams and reputable companies. If
        you are looking for a broker to trade with on your own, you can find

        Gaps</strong></p> <p style="text-align: justify;">During the recent
        market turmoil, there have been numerous price gaps in different
        financial products, including currencies, oil, and equities. Such gaps
        often happen without any warning or analytical information to suggest
        such an event will take place. During such market events, the prices
        quoted for executing trades and orders can vary significantly from one
        tick to the next and lead to an order not being filled or filled at a
        worse or better price than intended.</p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;"><a
        href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Schneider-Electric-renforce-gestion-risque-fournisseurs-T.jpg/Schneider-Electric-renforce-gestion-risque-fournisseurs-T.jpg.html"><img

        alt="" width="300" height="150" /></a></p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;">In order to avoid risks of price gap movements, it is
        suggested to reduce the size of your trading position before market
        closing &#8211; for example, overnight rollovers for such CFD products,
        as oil contracts and over the weekend. During increased market
        volatility, the opening price following the resumption of trading can
        often be far away from the previous closing price. <em>By reducing your
        trading position, you can reduce the risk of losses due to such price
        discrepancy. By closing positions entirely before market close over the
        weekend traders essentially remove all risks of adverse price changes at
        market open the following business day.</em></p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;"><strong>Using Stop Loss Orders</strong></p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">A great way to limit downside risk to open
        trades is to use contingent orders, such as “stop-loss”, to reduce the
        negative exposure should the price of the instrument you are trading go
        against you. Such order types are commonplace on all popular trading
        platforms across FX, CFD, and equities brokers. <em>When using stop-loss
        orders traders are advised to study their broker’s policy on stop-loss
        order executions, as such orders may in certain volatile market
        situations be triggered and filled at a price that is different from the
        requested price in the order. In such situations, the trader’s order can
        be filled at a worse price than requested. Your broker’s trading
        policies will explain how the broker deals with such situations so you
        can plan your trading strategy accordingly.</em></p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Closeout or Liquidation
        Level</strong></p> <p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re trading on
        a Forex or CFD trading account with leverage, your account will have a
        “close out” or “liquidation level” &#8211; that is the level of margin
        in your account, at which the broker will automatically close all of
        your open trades and orders because you do not have any more free margin
        to keep positions open. Brokers can have a liquidation level of 150%,
        100% or lower, such as 50%. This means that if the % of available margin
        level (i.e. net equity/required margin) in your account falls below this
        critical level, your traders/orders will be liquidated immediately.
        <em>To reduce the risk of liquidations, we recommend that you know your
        closeout/liquidation level on the trading account. By calculating how
        low your available margin balance can go you can then understand how
        much more risk you can take on your open or pending trades and orders.
        Knowing how much available margin you must maintain at all times on your
        account will help you make better risk management decisions by
        incorporating the other risk factors above.</em></p> <p

        ><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Why do Forex Binary
        Options have Short-term Expirations?</strong></p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;">The price dynamics of the forex market has often been
        characterized by both academics and practitioners as a random walk. This
        means that the exchange rate of a currency pair has an equal probability
        of an upward and downward movement, such that the expected change in the
        exchange rate (at least in the short term) is equal to zero.
        Consequently, the average trader should not expect to be able to predict
        the future direction of exchange rates in a consistent manner.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">Putting this together with the asymmetric
        payout of binary options, traders are at a disadvantage when it comes to
        predicting the short term price movement of exchange rates. It is
        because of this disadvantage that binary options have short term
        expirations, which makes it very hard for the trader to predict the
        direction of exchange rates within a few minutes or hours.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Bid-Ask Spread</strong></p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">The spread between the bid and ask quotes
        offered by the broker is an additional cost that the trader must be
        aware of when dealing with binary options. In general, a broker quotes
        two prices for an exchange rate: the bid price, which is the price at
        which the broker will buy an asset at, and the ask price, which is the
        price at which the broker will sell at. For example, a broker might
        quote EURUSD at 1.15000 / 1.15004, which means that a trader can buy 1
        Euro for 1.15004 USD and can sell 1 Euro for 1.15000 USD.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">In the context of binary options, the
        bid-ask spread is often included in the marking of the option.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">As such, a trader who buys a binary call
        option will have essentially bought into the option at an ask price of
        EURUSD 1.15004. If we assume that the EURUSD exchange rate does not
        change and the spread remains the same until the option expires, then
        the option is closed (or marked to market) at the bid price of 1.15000,
        which is lower than the initial ask price of 1.15004. This means that
        the binary call option expires at a loss for the trader.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">Consequently, the spread is an additional
        implied cost that the trader should take into account when trading
        binary options. During times of low market volatility and during normal
        trading hours, the spread is expected to remain the same. However, when
        market volatility is high and during times near the opening and closing
        of the market, the spread can widen significantly, thus putting the
        trader at a greater disadvantage.</p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;"><strong>How can Traders Minimize the Disadvantages Inherent in
        Binary Options Trading?</strong></p> <p style="text-align: justify;">As
        we have mentioned above, the asymmetric payoff of binary options,
        coupled with the random walk nature of exchange rates in the short term,
        and the bid-ask spread charged by the broker render binary options a
        risky investment. However, a trader can take certain measures to
        minimize the risk associated with binary options trading.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">First, traders should conduct proper due
        diligence and research about the broker they are trading with. In order
        to minimize the disadvantage associated with an asymmetric payout,
        traders should select brokers who offer the highest percentage
        payout.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Second, traders should also
        check the quoting and marking policy of the broker. Some brokers state
        that they charge a fixed bid-ask spread, while others state that they
        have a floating spread. The latter is riskier especially when the market
        is turbulent, which often implies that the spread will widen.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">Third, spreads are typically much wider at
        the start and end of a trading session. Due to this reason, traders
        should avoid trading options during these times in order to minimize the
        likelihood of widening spreads.</p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;">Fourth, given the random nature of the foreign exchange market
        in the short term, traders who possess some predictive skill should opt
        to trade binary options that have the longest time to expiration. This
        would give the option enough time to cover the spread as well as move in
        the direction that they have predicted. The shorter the time to
        expiration, the less likely it is that the exchange rate will change
        fast enough to cover the bid-ask spread and reach the target price of
        the option.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">By following the above
        recommendations, traders would be able to minimize the risk associated
        with binary options trading and increase the likelihood of having
        profitable trades.</p> ]]></content:encoded

        ><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Binary options are popular
        among beginner traders because they are very easy to understand. A
        binary option allows the trader to bet on whether the price of an asset
        will be above or below a certain target price (usually the current
        market price) at a future time. If a trader expects the price of an
        asset to increase, then they would buy a binary call option, which would
        result in a gain if the price of the asset rises above the target price.
        On the other hand, if the trader expects the price of the asset to drop,
        then they would buy a binary put option, which pays off if the price of
        the asset falls below the target price. The payout from a binary option
        is either a fixed amount in case the prediction by the trader is correct
        or nothing at all if the prediction is wrong. As such, these options are
        also referred to as cash-or-nothing options.</p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;"><strong>Asymmetric Payout of Binary Options</strong></p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">The reason why binary options are popular
        is because the payout typically ranges between 70% to 90% over a range
        of few minutes or hours, which makes them very enticing for a trader who
        wants to earn quick profits. However, binary options have a negative
        expected return because the payout is asymmetric. This asymmetry puts
        the trader at a disadvantage.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">To
        illustrate this point, consider a trader who expects the EURUSD exchange
        rate to rise over the next hour. The trader decides to buy a binary call
        option for a cost of $100 and is guaranteed an 80% payout if their
        prediction is correct regarding the EURUSD rate, but loses everything if
        the prediction is wrong. If the target (strike) EURUSD price of the
        binary call option is 1.15 then the payout from the option for different
        ending price scenarios can be illustrated as per the chart below.</p>
        <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="/wp-image-98437 size-full
        aligncenter"
        src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Binary-Options.png" alt=""
        width="610" height="374" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">If we assume that the price of the
        EURUSD exchange rate has an equal probability of rising or falling, then
        the expected return can be calculated as follows:</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">Win = $100 x 80% = $80</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">Lose = -$100 * 100% = -$100</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">Expected Return = (Win x 50%) + (Lose x
        50%) = -$10</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">In other words, a trader
        is expected to lose an average of $10 on each bet that is made.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">For this game to be fair, the outcome of a
        win scenario should be equal to the outcome of a lose scenario, which
        means that a trader needs to be able to win at least 56% of the time to
        make the expected outcome equal to zero (i.e. $80 x 56% -$100 x 44% = 
        0).</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"> ]]></content:encoded
