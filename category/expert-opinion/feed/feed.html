        ><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">An important notion that has
        been debated in financial literature is market heterogeneity.
        Traditional financial models adopt the popular assumption that markets
        are efficient and that participants act rationally such that their
        actions are homogeneous. Nevertheless, studies in behavioral finance
        provide significant evidence of patterns and biases which render the
        assumption of homogeneity too simplistic and idealistic. Heterogeneity
        in financial markets can be defined as significant diversity in
        expectations of asset prices.</p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;"><strong>Heterogeneity</strong></p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;">Many academics have argued that homogeneity is a very strong
        assumption, which does not hold, especially in the presence of
        speculative markets. This is because individuals exhibit different
        performance outcomes, and in many cases irrational behavior depending on
        the state of the market. Moreover, individuals may interpret the same
        piece of information differently due to their personal biases, thus
        leading to different conclusions about financial markets. As such, there
        has been a growing branch of literature, which advocates that financial
        markets are in fact heterogeneous and that one should take into account
        this phenomenon when examining asset returns as well as the performance
        of investors.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Trading Skills
        and Exogenous Factors</strong></p> <p style="text-align: justify;">I
        investigate whether traders possess genuine trading skills, and how
        market volatility affects their decisions. Using a large dataset of
        retail FX traders on the EUR/USD market I find significant evidence of
        heterogeneity in performance and expectations, which persists throughout
        their trading career.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">I show that
        while around 68% of traders have the ability to correctly predict future
        price changes more than half of the time, only around 22.8% have the
        ability to generate overall positive returns. In addition, around 27% of
        traders have the ability to favorably adjust their position size based
        on the magnitude of the change in market prices.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, I find that volatility has a
        detrimental impact on performance. However, as individuals learn to
        understand it they adjust for it in their trading decisions.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Effect of Behavioural Biases on
        Performance and Skill</strong></p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;">Finally, I investigate how five common behavioral biases
        affect traders’ performance. I find that skilled traders are herd
        initiators such that they are closely watched and mimicked by others.
        Skilled traders exhibit the disposition effect, whereby they are more
        likely to realize small gains and hold on to large losses. In addition,
        skilled traders are sensation seekers, meaning that they tend to use
        leverage to exploit price changes; however, they tend to avoid extreme
        levels of leverage which can be detrimental to their performance.
        Skilled traders are more likely to be inconsistent in the amount of
        leverage and margin they use, which is explained by their ability to
        adjust their leverage ratio depending on the state of the market and
        their confidence in their trading decision.</p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;">These behavioral patterns can also be used from a broker’s
        perspective in order to distinguish and categorize clients into
        different behavioral groups in order to hedge against those who are
        likely to be top performers based on their behavioral
        characteristics.</p> <p>Read the full article and references: <a

      <content:encoded
        ><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">We have all heard the
        expression “cut your losses” whenever it has become evident that we are
        wasting valuable time and resources on something that is deemed as
        failing. As logical as this advice may be, not everyone abides by it
        especially when it comes to financial decision making.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">In finance, this phenomenon is known as the
        disposition effect and represents a trader’s tendency to realize gains
        quickly while holding on to losses. Academics have identified several
        factors that contribute to this behavioral bias including mental
        accounting, loss-aversion, regret-aversion, and mean-reversion in asset
        prices.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">The disposition effect has
        been associated with poor financial performance. Nevertheless, several
        researchers have argued that traders can learn from their past trading
        activities to reduce the disposition effect. This means that, as traders
        become more aware of the impact of the disposition effect on their
        performance, they are more likely to avoid realizing gains too early and
        holding on to losses for too long.</p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;">What happens when traders find themselves in an environment
        where their actions are constantly on display, and where poor
        performance can instantly tarnish their trading reputation? Under such a
        setting, traders may exhibit a heightened sense of self-consciousness
        such that they become more aware of the consequences associated with
        displaying poor performance. Therefore, they would adapt their behavior
        to avoid displaying poor outcomes by limiting losses instead of holding
        on to them, and seek to realize larger gains in order to showcase their
        superior trading skills. Consequently, an environment that rewards good
        performance yet promotes constant scrutiny is expected to erode the
        disposition effect.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">To investigate
        this, Roland Gemayel and Alex Preda compare the disposition effect of
        traders on a traditional trading platform to that of traders on a social
        trading platform (or STP).</p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;"><strong>Social Trading Platforms and the Scopic
        Regime</strong></p> <p style="text-align: justify;">An STP is a novel
        concept that embeds online trading within a social media platform,
        creating a highly transparent marketplace where all information is
        public. This high level of transparency puts individuals under constant
        reciprocal scrutiny, which is an environment known as a scopic regime.
        This environment differs from traditional trading settings where trading
        records are held privately by the broker or the exchange.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">Participants on an STP can be classified
        into two groups: trade leaders and copiers. Trade leaders are those who
        aspire to become money managers by publicizing their reputation and
        managing the capital allocated to them by copiers in return for monetary
        rewards. Copiers can choose to copy a single trade or all future trades
        of a trade leader, and do not need to intervene except to end the
        copying relationship. In addition, copiers can diversify their capital
        across several trade leaders with different trading styles to avoid
        having excessive exposure to a single style.</p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;"><strong>The Disposition Effect under Different Trading
        Settings</strong></p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Roland and Alex
        find ample evidence of a weaker disposition effect for traders on the
        STP (i.e. under a scopic environment) compared to traders in a
        traditional trading setting. This supports the notion that the scopic
        regime, through its state of constant reciprocal scrutiny, erodes the
        disposition effect. This happens as traders become more self-conscious
        about their actions and aware of the consequences associated with poor
        performance on their reputation. As a result, they choose to realize and
        limit losses in order to avoid holding unjustifiable paper losses, while
        seeking to realize larger gains as a mechanism to signal their superior
        trading ability to potential copiers.</p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;"><strong>A Behavioral Risk Adjustment</strong></p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">One principal implication of the authors’
        study is that when individuals are under constant observation, they tend
        to alter their behavior from loss-averse to risk-averse. This occurs as
        traders choose to limit their exposure to losing investments, which
        reduces the risk associated with holding on to large losing
        investments.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">This relationship can
        be valuable to retail brokers and regulators, whose aim is to help
        traders adopt more effective risk management techniques. By
        incorporating social trading features into traditional online platforms,
        brokers would be enabling a scopic mechanism that is fueled by the
        collective scrutiny of all participants and that yields a
        risk-adjustment behavior at the individual trader level.</p> <p

        Reporting</strong></p> <p style="text-align: justify;">MiFIR transaction
        reporting requires the details of qualifying transactions to be reported
        to a National Competent Authority (“<strong>NCA</strong>”) or Approved
        Reporting Mechanism (“<strong>ARM</strong>”) within one day (T+1) of the
        transaction. It applies to transactions in financial instruments that
        are:</p> <ul style="text-align: justify;"> <li>admitted to trading or
        traded on a trading venue;</li> <li>whose underlying is a financial
        instrument admitted to trading or traded on a trading venue; or</li>
        <li>is an index of a basket comprised of such financial
        instruments,</li> <li>regardless of whether these transactions are
        traded outside the trading venue.</li> </ul> <p style="text-align:
        justify;">Transaction reports are required to include the identity of
        both the client and the trader or algorithm responsible for the
        investment decision and/or execution. Keep an eye out for a separate
        article which we will release shortly, explaining the requirements for
        executing agents.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Who
        has to report?</em></strong></p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;">Investment Firms as defined in <a
        href="http://kellian.webplus.net/MIFID2/Article4-Definitions.html"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">Article 4(1)(1) of MiFID II </a> and EEA
        branches of third country Investment Firms.</p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;"><strong>2. MiFID Commodity Position Reporting</strong></p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">Commodity derivatives listed on EEA trading
        venues (a Regulated Market (“<strong>RM</strong>”), Multilateral Trading
        Facility (“<strong>MTF</strong>”) or Organised Trading Facility
        (“<strong>OTF</strong>”)) and OTC derivative contracts that are deemed
        to be ‘economically equivalent’ to the venue listed instruments.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Who has to
        report?</em></strong></p> <p style="text-align: justify;">MiFID
        Investment Firms and EEA branches of third country Investment Firms who
        trade the relevant commodity derivatives.<strong> </strong></p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. EMIR Reporting</strong></p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">EMIR includes an obligation to report
        details of all derivatives to trade repositories.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Who has to
        report?</em></strong></p> <p style="text-align: justify;">All
        counterparties to derivative transactions including both financial and
        non-financial counterparties but not natural persons.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. MIFIR Trade
        Publication</strong></p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Also referred
        to as ‘trade reporting’, trade publication relates to the near real-time
        public dissemination of trade data through an Approved Publication
        Arrangement (“<strong>APA</strong>”) required for transactions in in EEA
        venue-listed instruments. These reports don’t require as much
        information as a transaction report – the focus is on execution data
        relating to volume and price – and only one report is required for the
        trade rather than by all firms involved in the transaction as with
        transaction reporting.</p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;"><strong><em>Who has to report?</em></strong></p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">Either the trading venue or where a venue
        isn’t involved then the publication requirement falls to the Systematic
        Internaliser (“SI”). SIs are investment firms which on an organised,
        frequent, systematic and substantial basis, deal on their own account
        when executing client orders outside a regulated market
        (“<strong>RM</strong>”), multilateral trading facility
        (“<strong>MTF</strong>”) or organised trading facility
        (“<strong>OTF</strong>”) (together, “<strong>Trading Venues</strong>”)
        without operating a multilateral system.</p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;">If no SI is involved in the transaction then the obligation
        falls upon an Investment Firm.</p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;"><strong>5. MiFIR Reference Data Reporting</strong></p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">MiFIR requires the submission of instrument
        reference data from certain firms. This will enable regulators to

        ><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A recent issue with the UK
        registered broker highlights the way client money protections work in
        the United Kingdom when it comes to Forex traders. As a result of
        investigations, the FSCS will be unable to compensate for any shortfalls
        in customers’ money held by Premier FX Limited.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">There has been a piece of very rough news
        for customers of a UK registered broker, Premier FX Limited, as <a
        href="https://www.fscs.org.uk/news/2018/august/premier-fx-limited-customers/"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Financial Services Compensation
        Scheme</a> (FSCS) has just announced it will not protect money held with
        the company.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Premier FX Limited was
        only ever permitted to carry out certain payment services known as
        ‘money remittance’. However, Premier FX was found to be acting outside
        of the boundary of these permissions by also holding customer money in
        their accounts.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">FSCS will not
        protect money customers held with Premier FX Limited because the firm
        was not authorised by the FCA to hold customer money in its accounts.
        This means FSCS will be unable to compensate for any shortfalls in
        customers’ money held by Premier FX Limited.</p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;">Premier FX Limited offered money transfer services to
        customers living and working abroad. Most of the firm’s business
        targeted expats living in Portugal and Spain.</p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;">On August 13, 2018 Premier FX Limited went into
        administration. <a
        href="https://financefeeds.com/fca-provides-info-customers-premier-fx-limited/"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Financial Conduct Authority</a> (FCA)
        appointed PKF Geoffrey Martin &amp; Co as the administrator.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">The FSCS advises Premier FX customer who
        have any queries to contact the Administrators PKF Geoffrey Martin &amp;
        Co on 020 7495 1100, or email <a
        href="mailto:premierfx@geoffreymartin.co.uk/mailto:premierfx@geoffreymartin.co.uk.html">premierfx@geoffreymartin.co.uk</a>.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The website of Premier currently
        displays a message from Dina Devalia and Peter Hart of PFK Geoffrey
        Martin &amp; Co., who have been appointed joint administrators of
        Premier.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Customers who have
        previously sent funds into Premier’s bank account(s) are advised to
        provide the information listed below, by either email or post. This will
        enable the Joint Administrators to address any queries and/or concerns
        the customers may have:</p> <ul style="text-align: justify;"> <li>A copy
        of one’s agreement with the Company;</li> <li>Confirmation as to the
        total funds sent into the Company’s bank account(s);</li> <li>A detailed
        breakdown of one’s payments to the Company’s accounts, including details
        of the amounts and dates the payments were made, which currency payment
        was made in and any written instructions to the Company in respect of
        the same. Where possible copy bank statements evidencing your payment(s)
        should also be provided;</li> <li>Details of the Company account(s) into
        which the payments were made.</li> </ul> <p style="text-align:
        justify;">The Joint Administrators says they are currently carrying out
        their statutory investigations into the business and the above
        information will assist them with any queries Premier’s customers may
        have.</p> <p><strong>This content was originally published by <a

        ><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In behavioral finance, herding
        occurs when traders make the same decisions either by intentionally
        imitating others, or unintentionally as a result of acting on common
        information. In recent years, the notion of herding has been capitalized
        on by brokerage firms and incorporated into online trading, creating a
        novel trading environment known as social trading.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is Social
        Trading?</strong></p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Social trading
        combines the conventional online trading model with the features offered
        by social media platforms. The result is a highly transparent
        marketplace called a social trading platform (STP), where participants
        can communicate, collaborate on strategies, and even explicitly copy
        each other’s trades in real-time using a mirror trading algorithm.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">STPs require complete disclosure and
        free flow of information from participants regarding their profiles as
        well as their trading activities. This means that whenever a person
        executes a trade, it instantly becomes public on their personal profile.
        Rational people would only be willing to disclose information if they
        were getting something in return. Accordingly, STPs have incentivized
        information sharing through compensation schemes by allowing traders to
        become money managers where they can earn monetary rewards when others
        copy their trades. This essentially categorizes participants into two
        main groups: trade leaders and copiers.</p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;">Trade leaders aim to build a superior track record by
        executing original trades in order to attract potential copiers, who in
        turn allocate their funds to a single trade or all future trades of a
        certain trade leader through a simple click of a button.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">The high level of transparency on STPs puts
        individuals under a spotlight of constant reciprocal scrutiny. This
        state is known as a scopic regime, and is meant to characterize the
        organization of an activity, such as trading, where participants observe
        each other’s activities in real time. This distinguishes STPs from
        conventional financial settings and institutions, such as mutual funds
        and hedge funds, where information on holdings and performance is only
        disclosed periodically by the former and voluntarily by the latter.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Value in Order Flow
        Data</strong></p> <p style="text-align: justify;">The collection of all
        trading records on a platform is known as the order flow. This
        aggregated data can be particularly valuable to traders in the foreign
        exchange market. Studies have shown that it can be used to forecast
        exchange rates. The importance of order flow information is further
        accentuated by the fact that there are infrequent announcements of
        fundamental data by governments and central banks.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">Given the fast-paced world of electronic
        trading, the limited capacity of individuals to analyze thousands of
        investment opportunities, the ease of access to detailed order flow
        data, and the aspiration to jump-start a career as a money manager and
        earn performance compensation, trade leaders on STPs may be highly
        tempted to avoid conducting their own analyses, and simply imitate their
        peers.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Consequently, one can argue
        that the competition to attract copiers in the scopic environment would
        augment the limitations and personal biases of trade leaders, thus
        producing excess and perpetual localized herding behavior as traders
        continuously rely on public order flow as a steady source of
        information.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, the
        efficient market hypothesis postulates that given an environment with
        high information transparency, prices should reflect all publicly
        disclosed information. Hence, despite the fact that STPs facilitate
        imitation, herding behavior should erode, as the information contained
        in public order flow data would already be incorporated into security
        prices. Moreover, retail traders in the foreign exchange market are not
        likely to possess private fundamental information. Hence, rational trade
        leaders would realize this and avoid herding.</p> <p style="text-align:
        justify;">Given the lack of research on this novel phenomenon, Roland
        Gemayel and Alex Preda investigated whether the scopic regime on STPs
        induces higher localized levels of and persistence in herding compared
        to those found in traditional trading environments.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Evidence on Herding under a Scopic
        Regime</strong></p> <p style="text-align: justify;">In general, Roland
        and Alex find that the overall level of herding under the scopic regime
        is significantly higher compared to those found in other traditional
        trading environments. Furthermore, they examine herding for different
        samples of traders based on trading intensity, leverage, and trade size
        and find that:</p> <ul> <li style="text-align: justify;">Trade leaders
        herd more when market information is scarce, suggesting that the scopic
        environment encourages traders to look at the activity of others as a
        source of information when making trading decisions;</li> <li
        style="text-align: justify;">Risk-seeking trade leaders herd less, which
        is in line with the idea that risk takers are overconfident in their own
        decisions;</li> <li style="text-align: justify;">Herding increases as
        investment size increases, since traders want to avoid the
        disappointment associated with underperforming their peers on large
        positions; and</li> <li style="text-align: justify;">Herding in the
        scopic environment persists across several time periods at much higher
        levels compared to herding in traditional environments.</li> </ul> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">These findings emphasize that the excess
        and perpetual herding produced by the scopic regime is intentional and
        arises due to the limitations and biases of retail traders.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Implications of
        Herding</strong></p> <p style="text-align: justify;">The high level of
        and persistence in herding behavior among trade leaders on STPs unveils
        several implications.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">From a
        macroeconomic perspective, intentional herding can increase volatility
        and destabilize markets due to the high correlation among trades. This
        issue may quickly materialize as STPs increase in popularity.</p> <p
        style="text-align: justify;">Second, regarding copiers who diversify
        their investments across multiple trade leaders, the benefits of
        diversification are significantly diminished in the presence of herding.
        This is because trade leaders who herd are effectively trading the same
        securities in the same direction and at the same time. Thus, copiers
        should take this into account when selecting the trade leaders they wish
        to allocate their funds to.</p> <p><em>Read the full article and
