        or licensed in several jurisdictions, we have demonstrated that
        membership with Financial Commission can help improve client experiences
        in the inevitable cases when dispute resolution is needed and while
        enhancing broker’s own compliance protocols.”</span></p> <p><span

        remedying complaints and commitment to education and best practices are
        some of the reasons that significant interest continues to be shown from
        both brokerages and platform technology developers who see the benefits
        of joining Financial Commission to enhance their own self-regulatory
        efforts. We are very pleased to have participated at this important

        Commission observed that while more regulations are coming to different
        jurisdictions, there is also an increased need for self-regulatory
        efforts in both established and evolving regulatory hubs as companies
        strive to demonstrate and maintain high standards of
        compliance.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following a
        successful event at the iFX Expo in Hong Kong earlier this year,
