        Financial Commission is an industry-supported self-regulatory

        independent external dispute resolution (EDR) organization for
        consumers/traders who are unable to resolve disputes directly with their
        financial services providers that are members of the Financial
        Commission. The Financial Commission initially set out to provide a new
        approach for traders and brokers alike to resolve any issues that arise
        in the course of trading electronic markets such as Foreign Exchange,
        and then expanded into CFDs and related derivatives, in addition to
        certifying technology platforms used for trading.</p>

        external dispute resolution (EDR) organization catering to the financial
        services industry, announces a public warning against a clone website
        (https://insecreg.com/) that mimics The Financial Commission in an
        attempt to defraud Forex traders.</p> <p>The Financial Commission took
        immediate steps to block the clone website and filed a claim with the
        domain registrar to take ownership of the all-too-similar domain address
        to ensure that traders are always accessing official materials of The
        Financial Commission. Moreover, The Financial Commission takes all
        necessary actions, including reporting to law-enforcement authorities
        and initiation of legal proceedings against “catfish”, in order to
        protect and prevent all fraudulent activities against its clients in the
        future.</p> <p>We remind the trading community that the Financial
        Commission services for traders are 100% free and our representatives
        will contact broker clients by phone or email only in response to an
        inbound inquiry received on our website and social media pages. The
        Financial Commission absolutely does not solicit payments or fees for
        its services from traders.</p> <p>The great lengths that companies may
        go to help perpetrate a fraud can be difficult for even the most
        cautious investors to detect. Be sure that the .org suffix is at the end
        of the URL when searching for our website, or clicking on related links
        when attempting to visit <a
        href="index.html">/</a> and <a
        href="https://financhttps:/financialcommission.io/contact-us/ialcommission.org/contact-us/">contact
        us</a> to verify any email you receive from anyone claiming to be
        affiliated with the Financial Commission.</p> <p><strong>About The

        target="_blank" rel="noopener">has announced</a> the publication of
        internal dispute resolution (IDR) reporting documents for a pilot
        project with registered companies for the second half of 2021.</p> <p
        style="text-align: left;">The goal of the pilot project is to streamline
        the IDR process across ASIC registered firms and the Australian
        Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA), which is tasked with
        investigating and resolving financial complaints. ASIC has published a
        <a

        target="_blank" rel="noopener">data dictionary</a> that sets out the
        information that financial firms will be required to collect and report
        to ASIC, and a<a
        href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-271-internal-dispute-resolution/#download"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener"> data glossary</a> that provides
        explanations about the key terms in the data dictionary.</p> <p
        style="text-align: left;">ASIC has asked firms to consider streamlining
        their own complaints systems to the data dictionary since registered
        firms have already been collecting complaints data as part of their own
        internal procedures.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">The new process
        looks to improve the cooperation between financial firms licensed by
        ASIC and having membership status at AFCA in order to improve IDR and
        external dispute resolution processes across financial sub industries in
        Australia.</p> ]]></content:encoded
