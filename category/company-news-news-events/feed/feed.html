        leading independent, non-governmental self-regulatory organization and
        external dispute resolution (EDR) forum announces its latest operational
        metrics for the first quarter of 2025. The organization experienced a

        including a decrease in amounts sought, awarded, average complaint
        values, and others. The forum continues to provide a quick and efficient
        service, with complaints being resolved on average in just 6.8 days as
        part of its quarterly Complaints Digest. </span></p> <p><span
        style="font-weight: 400;">As part of its founding core principles to
        protect traders from possible scams, Ponzi schemes, and fraudulent
        activities online, The Financial Commission placed over 12 new websites

        times slowed, yet continued to be quick </span></li> </ul>
        <p><b>Conclusions</b></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the
        Financial Commission witnessed a slowdown in new complaints from traders
        amid the winter holiday break, demand for external dispute resolution
        (EDR) remains steady, while continued efforts to improve customer
        satisfaction at member firms attributed to the decrease in traders
        requiring EDR services. Specifically, the organization experienced a 5%
        drop in new complaints filed, while the total number of complaints
        resolved in the quarter fell slightly by 2%. At the same time, total
        complaints amounts sought and awarded and average complaint values all
        decreased by 48%, 82%, and 44% respectively. In complaint categories,
        financial-related complaints continued to dominate for 1Q 2025, while
        non-trading complaints fell by 26%. Complaints valued up to $100 jumped
        22% during this period, while higher-value complaints in the $500-999
        category grew by 14%. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:
        400;">During the period, the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) resolved
        complaints slower than in the previous quarter, with 6.8 days in average
        dispute resolution time.</span></p> <p><b>About Financial
        Commission</b></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Financial
        Commission is an independent external dispute resolution (EDR)
        organization for consumers/traders who are unable to resolve disputes
        directly with their financial services providers who are members of the
        Financial Commission. The Financial Commission initially set out to
        provide a new approach for traders and brokers alike to resolve any
        issues that arise in the course of trading electronic markets such as
        Foreign Exchange, and then expanded into CFDs and related derivatives,
        in addition to certifying technology platforms used for
        trading.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more

        Commission as of February 28th, 2025, and moving forward or until
        membership is approved again.</p> <p>Furthermore, Orfinex clients will
        not be eligible for reimbursement from the Financial Commission’s
