        33% to 51%, effectively taking command of StrikeX&#8217;s technology

        Markets&#8217; ongoing commitment to Web3 innovation, providing direct
        access to StrikeX’s advanced blockchain infrastructure, tokenisation
        frameworks, and digital wallet technology—all crucial elements in
        developing cutting-edge financial products.</p> <p><a
        href="https://financefeeds.com/cmc-markets-acquires-33-stake-in-uk-blockchain-firm-strikex/"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMC initially invested in StrikeX in
        2023</a>, viewing the 33% stake as a strategic move into tokenised
        finance and self-custody solutions. With majority ownership now secured,
        StrikeX formally integrates into the CMC Markets group, accelerating
        product development, facilitating regulatory approvals, and enabling
        broader international expansion.</p> <p>As part of the agreement, CMC
        Markets has also increased its holdings of StrikeX’s native STRX tokens
        from 10 million to 15 million, further solidifying its commitment to the
        StrikeX ecosystem.</p> <p>“This majority acquisition represents a
        significant leap forward in our ambition to lead in digital assets,”
        said Lord Peter Cruddas, CMC’s founder and CEO. “We are building a
        future-ready platform to deliver regulated, institutional-grade access
        to tokenised assets and blockchain-powered solutions.”</p> <p>StrikeX
        CEO Joe Jowett has previously highlighted the partnership as a
        pioneering effort to bring conventional financial instruments—such as
        equities, bonds, and commodities—to blockchain technology.</p>
        <p>StrikeX, a burgeoning blockchain enterprise based in London, is
        dedicated to creating accessible tools that integrate traditional
        financial assets onto blockchain platforms compliantly. Notably, it
        developed TradeStrike, an intuitive wallet and trading platform tailored
        specifically for Web3 applications.</p> <p><a

        target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CMC Markets</a>’ enhanced
        involvement with StrikeX reflects a broader industry trend of
        traditional financial institutions increasingly adopting blockchain and
        tokenisation technologies.</p> <p>Earlier this year, in January, <a
        href="https://financefeeds.com/cmc-markets-stock-tumbles-despite-50-revenue-boost/"
        target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CMC Markets</a> reassured
        stakeholders that the company was well-positioned to meet its forecasted
        annual net operating income targets. Additionally, the firm reaffirmed
        its anticipated costs guidance at approximately £225 million, excluding
        variable remuneration and one-off charges.</p> <p>CMC Markets has
        scheduled the publication of its full financial results for fiscal year
        2025 on June 5, 2025. Despite market anticipation of an upward revision,
        the firm maintained its previous financial projections, aligning closely
        with market forecasts.</p> ]]></content:encoded

        renewed shareholder unrest over its executive pay policies, with a
        majority of investors voting against the company’s remuneration report
        for the second consecutive year.</p> <p class="" data-start="443"
        data-end="734">According to a disclosure filed with the London Stock
        Exchange, 51% of shareholders opposed the 2024 remuneration report
        during the company’s annual general meeting (AGM). This marks another
        significant blow for the trading platform, following a 65.8% vote
        against executive pay in 2023.</p> <p class="" data-start="736"
        data-end="985">The opposition centers around compensation awarded to CEO
        David Zruia and CFO Elad Even-Chen, who each received nearly $5 million
        in pay packages last year, up from $3.7 million previously, despite a
        mixed performance across recent quarters.</p> <p class=""
        data-start="987" data-end="1220">The AGM also revealed that 22% of
        shareholders voted against reappointing Steve Baldwin as a non-executive
        director. While the motion passed, the level of dissent underscores
        ongoing dissatisfaction with the company’s governance.</p> <p class=""
        data-start="1222" data-end="1508">Despite these concerns, Plus500 raised
        its 2025 outlook, even as its Q1 results painted a complex picture.
        Revenue increased 13% quarter-on-quarter but declined 5% year-on-year.
        EBITDA climbed 23% over the previous quarter, though it was still 9%
        lower than the same period in 2024.</p> <p class="" data-start="1510"
        data-end="1782">Customer engagement metrics revealed further challenges.
        The platform attracted 26,897 new users in Q1, a decline from over
        36,000 in Q4 2024. Active users also fell 4% to 130,514. However,
        average deposit per user surged to $12,450, more than double the prior
        figure.</p> <p class="" data-start="1784" data-end="2126">In response to
        the shareholder vote, the Plus500 board stated it is taking the feedback
        seriously and plans to continue engaging with stakeholders to improve
        corporate governance and executive pay practices. The board emphasized
        that shareholder input will shape future decisions and acknowledged the
        company’s unique operating structure.</p> <p class="" data-start="2128"
        data-end="2374">In early 2025, Plus500 became a clearing member of ICE
        Clear US, aiming to reduce trading costs and expand services. The
        company also secured a UAE regulatory license, enabling it to offer
        futures and stock trading products in the region.</p> <p class=""
        data-start="2376" data-end="2640">Plus500 reported record growth in its
        B2B and retail futures trading segments, driven by its flagship product,
        Plus500 Futures. The company further expanded by entering the Japanese
        market with a localized trading platform tailored to retail
        investors.</p> <p class="" data-start="2642" data-end="2956">Meanwhile,
        the broker continues to strengthen its regulatory footprint. It received
        a license from the Securities Commission of the Bahamas in July 2023 and
        has since reported promising growth in the Middle East, particularly
        after obtaining approval from the Dubai Financial Services
        Authority<strong data-start="2910" data-end="2955"> (<a

        moving closer to becoming a comprehensive personal finance platform. The
        company has announced <strong data-start="303" data-end="324">Robinhood
        Banking</strong>, a new online-only checking and savings service
        launching this fall exclusively for <strong data-start="409"
        data-end="427">Robinhood Gold</strong> members.</p> <p class
        data-start="438" data-end="781">The banking product offers a <strong
        data-start="467" data-end="503">4% annual percentage yield
        (APY)</strong> and <strong data-start="508" data-end="545">FDIC
        insurance up to $2.5 million</strong>. This coverage is made possible
        through a “pass-through” partnership with <strong data-start="620"
        data-end="646">Coastal Community Bank</strong>, an FDIC member. Although
        Robinhood isn’t a licensed bank, the collaboration enables it to insure
        deposits on behalf of its customers.</p> <p class data-start="783"
        data-end="1072">Users will manage their accounts through a dedicated app
        that allows them to <strong data-start="860" data-end="886">send and
        receive money</strong>, and even <strong data-start="897"
        data-end="947">have physical cash delivered to their doorstep</strong>.
        While full details about the cash delivery feature remain limited,
        Robinhood noted that availability will vary by location.</p> <p class
        data-start="1074" data-end="1348">At launch, Robinhood Banking will
        support <strong data-start="1116" data-end="1149">individual and joint
        accounts</strong>, with <strong data-start="1156"
        data-end="1179">children’s accounts</strong> expected in future updates.
        According to <strong data-start="1221" data-end="1235">Deepak
        Rao</strong>, GM of Robinhood Money, the platform is designed to solve
        common frustrations with traditional banking services.</p> <p class
        data-start="1350" data-end="1675">In addition, Robinhood introduced
        <strong data-start="1384" data-end="1408">Robinhood Strategies</strong>,
        a new wealth management tool available now for Gold subscribers. This
        feature offers <strong data-start="1495" data-end="1526">actively
        managed portfolios</strong> of stocks and ETFs, focused on
        diversification and growth. The service charges a <strong
        data-start="1608" data-end="1628">0.25% annual fee</strong>, capped at
        <strong data-start="1640" data-end="1657">$250 per year</strong> for
        Gold members.</p> <p class data-start="1677" data-end="1753">Robinhood
        Strategies will become available to all users starting next month.</p>
        <p class data-start="1755" data-end="1998">The company is also working
        on <strong data-start="1786" data-end="1796">Cortex</strong>, an <strong
        data-start="1801" data-end="1836">AI-powered investment
        assistant</strong> that will analyze market trends, provide investment
        insights, and recommend stocks. Set to launch later this year, Cortex
        will be accessible to Gold subscribers.</p> <p class data-start="2000"
        data-end="2318">These new services reflect Robinhood’s continued
        evolution from a free trading app into a full-service financial
        ecosystem. With tools for <strong data-start="2139"
        data-end="2185">banking, investing, and AI-driven insights</strong>,
        Robinhood aims to compete with both fintech disruptors and established
        banks in managing the <strong data-start="2280" data-end="2317">entire
