        ><![CDATA[<p><strong>Complaint Matter</strong></p> <p>Mr. XXX has lodged
        this complaint with the Financial Commission on the following
        grounds:</p> <p>The client used trading accounts ## 57454, 123052,
        156338, and 226712 for active transactions with Forex and CFD market
        instruments. By the time of the incident, the Client had opened several
        Long positions on the financial instrument USDRUB on the indicated
        accounts:</p> <ul> <li>Trading account #57454</li> </ul> <p>The total
        volume of the Long position on the USDRUB instrument was 12.2 lots;</p>
        <ul> <li>Trading account # 123052</li> </ul> <p>The total volume of the
        Long position on the USDRUB instrument was 12.2 lots;</p> <ul>
        <li>Trading account # 156338</li> </ul> <p>The total volume of the Long
        position on the USDRUB instrument was 13.2 lots;</p> <ul> <li>Trading
        account #226712</li> </ul> <p>The total volume of the Long position on
        the USDRUB instrument was 10.2 lots.</p> <p>Thus, the total volume of
        the Client’s Long position before the incident was 47.8 lots. To ensure
        the fixation of potential profit on all specified positions, the Client
        set pending Sell Limit (Take Profit) orders at the price level of
        77.77.</p> <p>The incident on the Client&#8217;s trading account
        occurred on Tuesday, March 21, 2023, at 04:00 (time GMT). At the
        specified time, as a result of an unfavorable change in the price of the
        USDRUB financial instrument, the margin level on the Client’s trading
        accounts fell below critical (60%), resulting in positions ## 28807109,
        28807614, 28808095, 28808455, 28808666, 28808838, 28809129, 28810459,
        28810910, 28811586, 28811728, 2881292 9, 28807115, 28807609, 28808100,

        forcibly liquidated by the Broker (Stop Out). The total amount of the
        Client&#8217;s financial losses as a result of the incident amounted to
        13,742,000 RUB.</p> <p>The Client does not agree with the Broker’s
        decision on his claim (see below) and believes that the disputed
        positions were liquidated by the Broker unlawfully. In support of his
        position, the Client points to two circumstances: firstly, the closing
        of these positions was carried out by the Broker at prices significantly
        different from the current market prices of other independent financial
        service providers, secondly, the liquidation of the disputed positions
        occurred 3 hours earlier, What usually happens when a trading session
        for the USDRUB financial instrument opens on the Broker’s platform.</p>
        <p>In connection with the above, the Client requests the Resolution
        Committee of the Financial Commission to verify the correctness and
        legality of the Broker’s actions during the incident and also to oblige
        the latter to compensate for financial losses in the amount of
        13,742,000 RUB, which arose as a result of the incorrect, in the
        Client’s opinion, forced liquidation of these positions.</p> <p>For its
        part, the Broker does not see any grounds for the Client’s claim and
        believes that all of his transactions were executed correctly, at market
        prices current at the time of the transaction and in full compliance
        with the provisions of regulatory documents, as well as the trading
        conditions accepted by the Company. In support of its position, the
        Broker provided the history of the Client’s trading operations, as well
        as the trading server log records during the incident.</p> <table

        Response:</strong></p> <p>The decision on this complaint is based on the
        information provided by the brokerage company XXX  and Mr. XXX</p>
        <p>After a comprehensive analysis of the documentary evidence provided
        by the Client and the Broker the Dispute Resolution Committee of the
        Financial Commission has come to the following conclusions:</p>
        <p>According to information received from the Broker, the company does
        not influence the flow of quotes that are broadcast on the platform. The
        Broker claims that the positions indicated by the Client ## 28807109,
        28807614, 28808095, 28808455, 28808666, 28808838, 28809129, 28810459,

        at current market prices available at the time of the incident and
        received from the Broker’s liquidity provider.</p> <ol> <li>Regarding
        the time of liquidation of positions on the Broker’s platform, which is
        also mentioned by the Client in the text of his complaint. In this
        regard, it should be noted that according to the information specified
        in the specification of the USDRUB financial instrument on the Broker’s
        website, the trading session for the specified instrument on the
        Broker’s platform begins at 07:05 GMT. In response to a request from the
        Resolution Committee, the Broker reported that the Company’s liquidity
        provider provides quotes for the USDRUB currency pair around the clock,
        while trading conditions for the USDRUB currency pair in the period from
        15:55 to 07:05 GMT correspond to the term “Thin Market” defined in
        section 14 Client Agreement:</li> </ol> <p><em>14.1. In this Agreement,
        the following terms have the following meanings: − “Market Conditions
        Other than Normal” means “Thin Market” or “Fast Market”. … − “Fast
        market” means a market condition characterized by rapid exchange rate
        changes in a short period of time. Often accompanied by price gaps.
        Typically occurs immediately before and/or immediately after one or more
        events: a. publication of the main macroeconomic indicators for the
        global economy that have a high degree of influence on financial
        markets; b. announcement of interest rate decisions by central banks or
        their committees; c. speeches and press conferences of the heads of the
        Central Bank, heads of state, finance ministers and other important
        statements; d. conducting foreign exchange interventions by government
        organizations; e. terrorist acts of national (state) scale; f. natural
        disasters that caused the introduction of a state of emergency (or
        similar restrictive measures) in the affected areas; g. the outbreak of
        war or hostilities; h. political force majeure events: resignations and
        appointments (including based on election results) of representatives of
        the executive branch of states; i. other events that have a significant
        impact on the dynamics of the instrument’s exchange rate.</em></p>
        <p>For this reason, the Company decided to establish a trading break for
        clients and limit their ability to conduct trading operations on the
        thin market during the specified period of time. During the trading
        break established for clients, the company constantly calculates and
        monitors the level of margin on clients’ trading accounts at current
        market rates provided by the liquidity provider. Calculation and control
        of the margin level is carried out in order to timely liquidate trading
        positions in cases where the margin level on the client’s account falls
        below 60% and approaches negative values. In such cases, in accordance
        with Section 11 of the Trading Regulations and the definition of Stop
        Out, the Company has the right to close any or all open trading
        positions without the client’s consent and prior notice.</p> <ol
        start="2"> <li>According to the trading conditions specified in the
        corresponding section on the Broker’s website, as well as in the
        Broker’s regulatory documents, trading accounts ## 57454, 123052,
        156338, and 226712 of the Client have Stop Out at the level of 60%. The
        opening of trading accounts of the specified type by the Client means
        the latter’s agreement to accept the trading conditions offered by the
        Broker. In this regard, it should be noted that, according to the
        information provided by the Broker, the positions disputed by the Client
        are ## 28807109, 28807614, 28808095, 28808455, 28808666, 28808838,

        28810923, 28811515, 28811844, 28813094, 28807088, 28807182, 28807594,
        28808051, 28808441, 28808681, 28808816, 28809116, 28810468, 28810917, 28

        28812880 were closed in accordance with the provisions of Section 11 of
        the Trading Regulations, that is, due to a decrease in the margin level
        on trading accounts below 60%:</li> </ol> <p><em>11.1. Margin is a
        collateral that provides the opportunity to receive funds for temporary
        use to carry out speculative transactions on the Trading Platform. 11.2.
        The margin level in the Trading Platform is calculated using the
        following formula: (Funds/Collateral)*100%. 11.3. The Company has the
        right to reject any trading order to open a trading position if there is
        insufficient free margin on the Client’s trading account. 11.4. The
        Client undertakes to maintain a margin level of at least 60%. 11.5. The
        Company has the right but is not obligated, to close any or all open
        trading positions if the margin level on the Client&#8217;s trading
        account falls below 60%. Typically, but not necessarily, the most
        unprofitable open trading position is closed first. 11.6. Forced closure
        of the Client&#8217;s trading position by the Company is called stop
        out.</em></p> <ol start="3"> <li>To ensure an objective investigation,
        the Resolution Committee requested the history of quotes for the
        financial instrument in the Client’s disputed positions at the time of
        the incident from other independent financial service providers. The
        Financial Commission uses several different sources such as Verify My
        Trade, Tradeproofer, Tradefora, TrueFX, FX Benchmark and some others to
        check the quality of trade execution. According to the general opinion
        of the Committee members, the financial result obtained by the Client in
        these transactions (-13,742,000 RUB) should be cancelled by the Broker.
        The Committee members came to this conclusion after comparing the
        Broker’s quotes offered to the Client with quotes obtained from other
        reliable sources. During the period of the incident (03/21/2023, 04:00
        GMT), quotes for the financial instrument USDRUB in the Broker’s quote
        stream differed significantly from quotes received from other
        independent financial service providers and thus did not reflect the
        real situation on the market. In this regard, it is also worth noting
        that the Broker did not agree to disclose its source of quotes for the
        financial instrument USDRUB in response to a request from members of the
        Resolution Committee, citing the NDA signed with the quote
        provider.</li> </ol> <p>Based on the above information, the Resolution
        Committee made a decision in favour of the Client. The Committee experts
        came to a consensus that the Broker’s forced liquidation of disputed
        positions ## 28807109, 28807614, 28808095, 28808455, 28808666, 28808838,

        28812880 of the Client during the incident occurred incorrectly. In
        accordance with the decision made, the Broker must cancel the financial
        result obtained by the Client in the disputed transactions and return
        funds in the amount of 13,742,000 RUB to the Client’s corresponding

        50743483, 50900194, 51427174, 52024537 of the Client were forcibly
        liquidated by the Broker due to a shortage of margin collateral (Stop
        Out). The total amount of the Client&#8217;s financial losses as a
        result of the incident amounted to 171,745.44 RUR. The Client does not
        agree with the Broker’s decision (see below) regarding his claim and
        believes that the Broker’s liquidation of the disputed positions was
        carried out unlawfully.</p> <p>According to the Client, during the
        period of the incident Stop Out should not have worked on his trading
        account, since the disputed positions were liquidated immediately after
        the Broker increased the spread on the EURAUD financial instrument to
        more than 300 points (0.00300). According to the Client, at the
        beginning of the trading session, the spread for this currency pair at
        the Broker was a maximum of 260 points. After increasing the spread to
        300+ points and liquidating the disputed positions, the Broker reduced
        the spread to 60–70 points and the price began to change in a direction
        favorable to the Client.</p> <p>In addition to the above, the Client
        claims that the liquidation of positions occurred without warning from
        the Broker about the low margin percentage. At the time the spread
        widened in the first hour of trading, the margin percentage was 124%.
        The liquidation of positions occurred at a margin level of 1.59%,
        although in the “Trading Conditions” section on the Broker’s website it
        is indicated that the Stop Out level is 20%.</p> <p>In connection with
        the above, the Client requests the Resolution Committee of the Financial
        Commission to verify the correctness and legality of the Broker’s
        actions to liquidate the disputed positions during the incident. As
        documentary evidence, the Client provided the investigation with
        screenshots of the price dynamics of the financial instrument EURAUD and
        the parameters of trading account # XXX 57 minutes before the incident,
        taken from the Broker’s trading platform.</p> <p>For its part, the
        Broker does not see any grounds for the Client’s claim and believes that
        all of his transactions were executed correctly, at market prices
        current at the time of the transaction and in full compliance with the
        provisions of regulatory documents, as well as the trading conditions
        accepted by the Company.</p> <p>According to the Broker, during the
        incident no errors or failures in the operation of services were
        recorded on the Company’s side. In support of its position, the Broker
        provided the history of the Client’s trading operations, the trading
        server log records, as well as the history of tick data for the EURAUD
        financial instrument during the incident.</p> <table border="1"

        Response:</strong></p> <p>The decision on this complaint is based on the
        information provided by the brokerage company XXX  and Mr. XXX</p>
        <p>After a comprehensive analysis of the documentary evidence provided
        by the Client and the Broker the Dispute Resolution Committee of the
        Financial Commission has come to the following conclusions:</p> <ol>
        <li>First of all, it is necessary to note the fact that the incident on
        the Client’s trading account occurred during a thin market period, at
        the beginning of the Asian trading session after the weekend. The client
        should be aware that during this period there is often a significant
        decrease in liquidity in the market. In turn, this circumstance
        radically changes the flow of quotes, leading to a sharp widening of
        spreads and the formation of price gaps. The Client must be aware that
        conducting trading operations in such market conditions is accompanied
        by significant risks.</li> </ol> <ol start="2"> <li>Secondly, it should
        be noted that Stop orders, which also include an order of the Buy
        Stop/Sell Stop type, inherently do not guarantee the execution of client
        orders exactly at the price specified in them. Depending on the market
        situation, such orders can be executed either exactly at the price
        specified in them, or at a price worse than specified. A pending Stop
        order becomes active as soon as at least one quote in the stream of
        prices broadcast by the broker reaches the price value specified by the
        client.</li> </ol> <p>If we reveal in detail the logic of executing a
        Stop order on the real market, it will look like this: when the market
        reaches the price specified in the client’s order, the system submits a
        Market order at any price available on the market (in the market depth)
        for a given volume. In this case, execution will occur according to the
        queue of current positions registered on the Broker&#8217;s server.</p>
        <ol start="3"> <li>Thirdly, according to the trading conditions
        specified in the corresponding section on the Broker’s website, as well
        as in the Broker’s regulatory documents (see clauses 2.1, 2.4 c) of the
        Regulations for trading operations for Standard Market MT4 accounts),
        the Client’s trading account has a floating spread , as well as Stop Out
        at 20%. Opening a trading account of the specified type by the Client
        means the latter’s consent to accept the trading conditions offered by
        the Broker. In this regard, it should be noted that according to the
        information provided by the Broker, during the period of the incident,
        the margin level on the Client’s trading account dropped below critical
        (1.56%), and therefore, the Broker forcibly liquidated the Client’s
        unprofitable positions ## 50743483, 50900194, 51427174, 52024537 . This
        fact is confirmed by the trading server log records, as well as the
        history of tick data for the financial instrument EURAUD, provided by
        the Broker. The Broker’s actions during the incident fully comply with
        the provisions of clauses 7.1-7.2 of the Regulations:</li> </ol> <p>7.1
        The Company has the right to forcefully close the Client’s open
        positions without consent and any prior notice if the “Equity”/“Funds”
        ratio on the trading account falls below the Stop out level. The Stop
        out level is indicated on the Company’s website in the “Trade
        conditions” section.</p> <p>7.2 The margin level is controlled by the
        server, which, if condition 7.1 is met, generates an order to forcefully
        close all positions on instruments during their trading session without
        prior notice. Stop out is executed at the market price in the order of
        the general queue with the Clients&#8217; orders. The Client agrees that
        the execution price may differ from the quote at which the Stop out
        order was generated. Forced closing of a position is accompanied by a
        corresponding entry in the server log file with the comment “Stop out or
        so”.</p> <ol start="4"> <li>Fourthly, regarding the Broker’s obligation
        to warn the Client about the need to replenish the balance of the
        trading account due to a drop in the margin level on his trading
        account, which the Client also mentions in the text of his complaint. In
        this regard, it should be noted that, according to the provisions of the
        Broker’s regulatory documents:</li> </ol> <p>2.34 The Client undertakes
        to independently monitor the level of the required margin on his trading
        account.</p> <ol start="5"> <li>Fifthly, to ensure an objective
        investigation, the Resolution Committee requested the history of quotes
        for the financial instrument in the Client’s disputed positions at the
        time of the incident from other independent financial service providers.
        The Financial Commission uses several different sources such as Verify
        My Trade, Tradeproofer, Tradefora, TrueFX, FX Benchmark and some others
        to check the quality of trade execution. According to the general
        opinion of the Committee members, the financial result (-171745.44 RUR)
        obtained by the Client in the disputed transactions should be canceled
        by the Broker. The Committee members came to this conclusion after
        comparing the Broker’s quotes offered to the Client with quotes obtained
        from other reliable sources. During the period of the incident, quotes
        for the financial instrument EURAUD in the Broker&#8217;s quote stream
        differed significantly from quotes received from other independent
        financial service providers, and thus did not reflect the real situation
        on the market.</li> </ol> <ol start="6"> <li>Finally, it should also be
        noted that when making a decision on this claim, the members of the
        Committee took into account the following circumstances:</li> </ol> <p
        style="padding-left: 40px;">a) The Client did not use pending Stop Loss
        orders to limit potential financial losses on disputed positions ##
        50743483, 50900194, 51427174, 52024537, and was thus prepared to lose
        the entire deposit under certain circumstances.</p> <p
        style="padding-left: 40px;">b) a few hours after the incident, the price
        of the EURAUD financial instrument reached the level at which Stop Out
        on the Client’s trading account should have been triggered.</p> <p
        style="padding-left: 40px;">c) the Client&#8217;s pending Take Profit
        orders were not and could not be executed until now, since the price of
        the EURAUD financial instrument did not reach the appropriate
        levels.</p> <p>Taking into account the above, as well as the documentary
        evidence provided by the Broker, the Committee experts came to a
        consensus that the Broker’s liquidation of the Client’s unprofitable
        positions ## 50743483, 50900194, 51427174, 52024537 was incorrect. In
        connection with this circumstance, the members of the Committee proposed
        a compromise solution to the parties to the dispute: to restore
        positions ## 50743483, 50900194, 51427174, 52024537, provided that the
        Client is ready to deposit additional funds into the trading account #
        XXX necessary to maintain these positions (taking into account the level
        Stop Out 20%, as well as the price dynamics of the EURAUD financial
        instrument that took place after the incident).</p> <p>If the Client is
        ready to restore the disputed positions, and within three days from the
        date of this decision fulfills the conditions named by the Committee,
        the disputed positions must be restored by the Broker.</p> <p><em>This

        ><![CDATA[<p><strong>Complaint Matter</strong></p> <p>Mr. XXX has lodged
        this complaint with the Financial Commission on the following
        grounds:</p> <p>The Client used account # XXX (USD) for trading
        operations with the financial instruments of the FX market. According to
        the Client, he has been a user of the Broker since October 10, 2022,
        with more than 850 positions closed on the specified account.</p> <p>The
        Client indicates that everything was fine for almost a year with nearly
        800 executed Limit orders at correct prices, but since July 24, 2023,
        lots of Limit orders placed by the Client have been executed at prices
        worse than the price indicated in the order (Buy Limit orders executed
        at higher prices and Sell Limit orders executed at lower prices) which,
        in the Client’s opinion, is obviously against definitions, standards and
        rules, and is causing additional losses to the Client. The Client filed
        a complaint with the Broker and described the newly occurred problem in
        detail with all necessary data and asked the Broker to fix the issue.
        The Broker did not uphold the Client’s complaint, indicating that orders
        for MT5 account # XXX were executed at the next available prices
        provided by their Liquidity Providers.</p> <p>In addition, the Broker
        indicated that No Liquidity Provider/Exchange/Execution Venue can
        guarantee execution at declared prices but instead on available market
        prices.</p> <p>The Client does not agree with the Broker&#8217;s
        decision (see below), accuses the latter of misconduct, and requests the
        Dispute Resolution Committee to verify the correctness of the execution
        of the disputed transactions, as well as the Broker’s actions in the
        period of the incident. The Client believes that a fair decision in the
        dispute would be for the Broker to fix the problem so that positions
        based on Limit orders are opened at the exact price indicated in the
        order or at a better price (as per the basic standards and rules) and it
        never repeats in the future. The Client provided the investigation with
        the screenshots showing the communication between the Broker and him
        regarding this incident, as well as the whole position history,
        including order type, order price and corresponding executed position
        opening price, with the disputed orders (and positions) highlighted in
        red, as documentary evidence.</p> <p>In turn, the Broker does not see
        any grounds for the Client&#8217;s complaint, since in their opinion all
        the Client’s orders/positions were processed correctly, at actual market
        prices and in full compliance with the provisions of their regulatory
        documents and the trading rules established by the Company. The Broker
        provided the investigation with the history of the Client’s
        trading/non-trading operations, as well as the FIX logs records for the
        entire period of the Client’s trading activity, as documentary
        evidence.</p> <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody>

        Response:</strong></p> <p>The decision on this complaint is based on the
        information provided by the brokerage company XXX  and Mr. XXX</p>
        <p>After a comprehensive analysis of the documentary evidence provided
        by the Client and the Broker the Dispute Resolution Committee of the
        Financial Commission has come to the following conclusions:</p> <ol>
        <li>First of all, it should be noted that according to the information
        provided by the Broker:</li> </ol> <p>a) The Client’s orders for MT5
        account # XXX were executed at the next available prices provided by the
        Broker’s Liquidity Providers. The Broker indicates that slippage can be
        positive or negative depending on factors like available liquidity,
        order type and volume.</p> <p>b) The Broker’s execution model of Limit
        and Stop orders assumes activation only after a trigger price indicated
        in the order is hit. When the price of the asset reaches the trigger
        price, a Market order is sent. A Market order will be executed at the
        current market price. The reason for this is to avoid clients’ order
        rejections due to not available liquidity at a certain price.</p> <p>с)
        In the Broker’s opinion, Market execution ensures that clients can trade
        under live streaming and best executable prices with immediate
        confirmations by the interbank market where Buy and Sell orders are
        matched up.</p> <p>d) The execution prices came directly from the LPs
        and no wrongdoing is recorded anywhere from outside, as confirmed by the
        FIX log records. The Company is dependent on 3rd parties which it has no
        control over.</p> <ol start="2"> <li>Second, in order to make an
        objective decision on this case the DRC has analyzed the trading
        activity in the Client&#8217;s account # XXX.<strong style="font-family:
        inherit; font-size: inherit;"> </strong></li> </ol> <p
        style="padding-left: 40px;">a) The general analysis of the transactions
        performed by the Client showed the following:</p> <ul> <li>The
        Client&#8217;s trades were carried out in the period from 10.10.2022 to
        06.09.2023.</li> <li>The Client’s trades were made with the financial
        instruments of the FX market (major and cross-currency pairs).</li>
        <li>The volume of the trades performed by the Client ranged from 0.01
        lots to 1.3 lots.</li> <li>The duration of the Client&#8217;s trades
        ranged from several minutes to several hours.</li> <li>Most of the
        Client’s trades were carried out during the hours of inactive market
        (immediately after the Rollover).</li> <li>Most of the Client’s trades
        were opened via Buy Limit/Sell Limit orders.</li> </ul> <p
        style="padding-left: 40px;">b) The analysis of the financial results of
        transactions performed by the Client showed the following:</p> <ul>
        <li>After 870 transactions the Client made a net profit in the amount of
        10 USD.</li> <li>The share of profitable trades performed on the
        Client’s account was 607 or 69.77%.</li> <li>The share of unprofitable
        trades performed on the Client’s account was 263 or 30.23%.</li> </ul>
        <p>с) The analysis of the execution quality of the trades provided by
        the Client for the investigation, which included 373 trades, showed the
        following:</p> <ul> <li>The share of trades opened with negative
        slippage was 56 or 15.01%.</li> <li>The share of trades opened with zero
        slippage was 77 or 20.64%.</li> <li>The share of trades opened with
        positive slippage was 240 or 64.34%.</li> </ul> <ol start="3">
        <li>Third, the DRC has also verified the validity of the Broker&#8217;s
        allegation regarding the Client&#8217;s abusive trading strategy aimed
        at finding the vulnerabilities of their technical equipment and software
        for profit. For this purpose, the DRC has examined the documentary
        evidence provided by the Broker, as well as the history of price data on
        the financial instruments in the disputed transactions, obtained from
        independent providers of financial services. To ensure an objective
        investigation Financial Commission uses several various sources, such as
        Tradeproofer, Tradefora, Verify My Trade, TrueFX, FX Benchmark and some
        others to verify the execution quality of trades. The analysis of the
        execution quality of the profitable transactions made by the Client in
        the period before July 24, 2023, showed that at least a part of them
        were opened and/or closed at prices much better than actual market
        prices available in the period of the incident (above the average or/and
        awesome execution).</li> </ol> <ol start="4"> <li>Fourth, based on the
        analysis of the history of the Client’s trading operations and the FIX
        log records provided by the Broker, it can be concluded that the Client
        indeed might have used special technical means (EA) exploiting
        inefficiencies in the Broker’s quotation system: on the daily basis, in
        the period immediately after the Rollover the Client placed pending Buy
        Limit/Sell Limit orders with Take Profit and Stop Loss orders attached
        to them (If Done type orders), on multiple financial instruments. The
        Client’s trading strategy is based on making profits from the sporadic
        market fluctuations that occur in the period of illiquid market, at the
        expense of the favorable execution (zero slippage or positive slippage)
        of Limit Orders at the Broker. In this regard it should also be noted
        that according to the Broker, the Company does not apply any filters on
        its pricing as they believe that pricing should always reflect market
        conditions.</li> </ol> <ol start="5"> <li>Fifth, the DRC members
        expressed their common opinion regarding the fact that, by its
        definition, a Buy Limit/Sell Limit order (including Take Profit orders)
        assumes execution at the requested price or at the best price at the
        time of order execution. Using this type of order, a trader understands
        and expects that their trade order given to a broker will be guaranteed
        to be executed at a price not worse than they requested. The Financial
        Commission also follows this approach, as this is an example of Fair
        Business Practice widely recognized throughout the financial services
        industry. So, in the general opinion of the DRC members, negative
        slippage for Limit orders for retail client is unacceptable, because it
        is against the definition of the Limit order. Buy Limit/Sell Limit
        orders (including Take Profit orders) should be placed on the market as
        Limit orders, and then at low market liquidity they will simply not be
        executed but will remain in the system in the waiting mode until market
        conditions allow their execution.</li> </ol> <ol start="6"> <li>Finally,
        from the technical point of view, MT4/MT5 platform allows to execute
        Limit orders with any slippage. Depending on the bridge software,
        brokers could execute Limit orders on LPs as actual Limit orders,
        execute them as Market orders on LPs after triggering of Limit price in
        MetaTrader, not to mention B-booking them with/or without slippage.</li>
        </ol> <p>Thus, on one hand the DRC members agreed that the Broker has
        sufficient grounds to claim that the Client indeed used special
        technical means (EA) exploiting inefficiencies in the Broker’s quoting
        system.</p> <p>In this regard, the experts of the DRC expressed a common
        opinion on the organization of the process of trading low-liquid
        financial instruments during a period of low market activity: if a
        broker cannot provide a normal supply of prices, they should prohibit
        trading or look for another source of quotations. Currently, there are
        many companies offering high-quality Market Data that can be used
        without any risk to business. The experts of the DRC believe that the
        Broker should bear the risks associated with the quality of the
        quotations supplied.</p> <p>On the other hand, the experts of the DRC
        expressed a common opinion that the Broker must adhere to the principles
        of Fair Business Practice, which in this particular case assumes the
        following: if the Broker does not have the technical ability to place
        Buy Limit/Sell Limit orders (including Take Profit orders) as Limit
        orders on the LP side, then they must either prohibit clients from using
        orders of this type on their platform (so as not to mislead the
        clients), either update the technical part of their infrastructure to
        place such orders as Limit, or accept the risk that they will have to
        cover negative slippage when executing pending orders from clients from
        their own funds.<strong> </strong></p> <p><em>This complaint was

        ><![CDATA[<p><strong>Complaint Matter</strong></p> <p>Mr. XXX has lodged
        this complaint with the Financial Commission on the following
        grounds:</p> <p>The Client used account # XXX (EUR) for active
        operations with the financial instruments of the FX market. On May 22,
        2023, the Client funded his trading account with 1500 EUR and started
        trading operations. By the time of the incident, the Client has made
        profits in the amount of 19905.52 EUR and successfully withdrawn 2094.73
        EUR from the specified account.</p> <p>The incident on the Client’s
        account occurred on July 27, 2023, i.e., on the day when the Broker
        performed a Cash Adjustment operation on the Client’s trading account
        and cancelled the Client’s request for withdrawal of funds in the amount
        of 301.58 EUR, claiming that the Client’s account was disabled for
        violation of the trading rules established by the Company. The Client
        indicates that the Broker has blocked his account for no apparent
        reason, since in the Client’s opinion, none of the Broker&#8217;s rules
        has been violated. According to the Client, the Broker does not let him
        withdraw profits, that, in the Client’s opinion, were legally acquired
        in the period of trading on the Broker’s platform.</p> <p>The Client
        does not agree with the Broker’s decision (see below) and considers the
        actions of the Broker as unfair. Also, the Client indicated that he had
        been trading for several months using the same trading strategy, without
        any issues. In connection with the above, the Client requests the
        Dispute Resolution Committee of the Financial Commission to check the
        disputed transactions for alleged violations and requires the Broker to
        return the rest of the withheld funds in the amount of 20207.10 EUR,
        which represents the rest of the Client’s deposit in the amount of
        301.58 EUR and accrued profits in the amount of 19905.52 EUR. The Client
        provided the investigation with the e-mail communication with the Broker
        regarding this complaint, as documentary evidence.</p> <p>In turn, the
        Broker claims that in the period of the incident, the Client has been
        using an EA that was trying to abuse the system (exploit weaknesses in
        the Broker’s trading platform). As such, the Broker does not see any
        grounds for the Client&#8217;s complaint and refers to the following
        provisions of Cl. 1.4.b.v, 9.3.b, and 12.6 of their Client Agreement,
        according to which:</p> <p><em>1.4. CLIENT REPRESENTATIONS AND
        WARRANTIES</em></p> <ol> <li><em>b)</em> <em>The</em> <em>Client</em>
        <em>represents and warrants to XXXX</em> <em>that:</em></li>

        Response:</strong></p> <p>The decision on this complaint is based on the
        information provided by the brokerage company XXX and Mr. XXX.</p>
        <p>After a comprehensive analysis of the documentary evidence provided
        by the Client and the Broker the Dispute Resolution Committee of the
        Financial Commission has come to the following conclusions:</p> <ol>
        <li>First, according to the Broker, prior to the incident, the Client
        identified a technical problem on the Broker’s side and implemented an
        abusive strategy aimed at making risk-free profits at the expense of
        lagging / non-market Moreover, the Broker points out that the Client
        coordinated his trading operations with other clients, the holders of
        trading accounts ## 1272956, 1279873, which is also a violation of the
        trading rules established by the Company. This fact is confirmed by the
        same CID registered in the server log records on the relevant
        accounts.</li> </ol> <ol start="2"> <li>Second, it should be noted that
        in order to make a decision on this case the DRC has analyzed the
        Client&#8217;s trading activity in his trading account # XXX</li> </ol>
        <p>a) The analysis of the nature of the transactions performed by the
        Client showed the following:</p> <ul> <li>The Client&#8217;s
        transactions were made in the period from 05.2023 to 27.07.2023.</li>
        <li>The Client’s transactions were made with one financial instrument:
        XAUUSD.</li> <li>The size of the Client’s transactions varied from 01 to
        4.48 lots.</li> <li>The duration of the Client&#8217;s transactions
        ranged from several minutes to several hours.</li> <li>The transactions
        performed on the Client’s account were made during the hours of active
        market</li> </ul> <p>b) The analysis of the financial results of
        transactions performed by the Client showed the following:</p> <ul>
        <li>After 307 transactions performed in the specified period, the amount
        of net profits accumulated on the Client’s trading account reached
        19905.52 EUR.</li> <li>The share of profitable transactions performed by
        the Client was 48% or 244.</li> <li>The share of unprofitable
        transactions performed by the Client was 52% or 63.</li> <li>The number
        of SO events that occurred on the Client’s account in the specified
        period was 2.</li> </ul> <ol start="3"> <li>Third, the DRC has verified
        the validity of the Broker&#8217;s assertion regarding the
        Client&#8217;s use of the vulnerabilities of their technical equipment
        and software for profit. For this purpose, the DRC has examined the
        documentary evidence provided by the Broker, as well as the history of
        price data on the financial instruments in the disputed transactions,
        obtained from independent providers of financial services.</li> </ol>
        <p>To ensure an objective investigation Financial Commission uses
        several different sources, such as Tradeproofer, Tradefora, Verify My
        Trade, TrueFX, FX Benchmark and some others to verify the quality of
        trades’ execution. The analysis of the execution quality of the
        Client&#8217;s trades showed that a significant part of the large-size
        trades (0.5 lots or more) performed in the period between 28.06.2023 and
        27.07.2023 were opened and/or closed at prices that were much better
        than the actual market prices available in the period of the
        incident.</p> <p>A good example of the above-mentioned abusive strategy
        utilized by the Client can be a series consisting of 4 consecutive
        profitable transactions with the financial instrument XAUUSD performed
        on the Client’s account on June 29, 2023.</p> <p>As such, in the common
        opinion of the DRC members, the Broker have sufficient grounds to assert
        that at least a part of transactions performed on the Client’s trading
        account # 1279859 were executed at lagging / non-market prices. It is
        highly likely that the Client might have used special technical means
        (EA) to exploit vulnerabilities in the Broker’s quotation system.</p>
        <ol start="4"> <li>On the other hand, the experts of the DRC also
        expressed a common opinion on the organization of the process of trading
        at the Broker. The experts of the DRC believe that if a broker cannot
        provide a normal supply of quotes, they should prohibit trading or look
        for another source of quotes. Currently, there are many companies
        offering high-quality market data that can be used without any risk to
        business. According to the experts of the DRC, the Broker should bear
        the risks associated with the quality of the quotations supplied.</li>
        </ol> <ol start="5"> <li>Furthermore, it should also be noted that in
        its decisions, the Financial Commission tries to adhere to the
        principles of Fair Business Practices, which imply, among other things,
        the following: if any problem is detected, its solution should be
        provided as soon as possible to mitigate the negative impact of this
        problem on the client. The Financial Commission adheres to the following
        rule: if the client has unfairly made a profit (using the
        vulnerabilities of the platform), then such profit must be recognized as
        illegitimate within 1-5 business days and debited from the
        client&#8217;s trading account. The client must be notified of the
        violation in a timely manner, and not after several weeks or months, at
        the stage of withdrawing funds from the client’s trading account.</li>
        </ol> <ol start="6"> <li>Finally, it should also be noted, that in the
        opinion of the DRC, the collaboration claim made by the Broker cannot be
        accepted in this case, since the Broker failed to identify and flag the
        customers based on their common digital traits, specifically by the same
        CID registered in the server log records on the relevant accounts.</li>
        </ol> <p>Thus, taking into account all of the above, the members of the
        DRC have decided:</p> <ol> <li>Not to recognize the transactions
        disputed by the Broker as legitimate;</li> <li>Consider the cancellation
        of the financial results of the disputed transactions by the Broker as
        lawful;</li> <li>Hold the Broker liable for the following points:</li>
        </ol> <p>a) The Company must bear the proper but limited responsibility
        for the occurrence of technical problems in its trading system and
        belated reaction in their elimination</p> <p>b) The Company must be duly
        responsible for the untimely notification of the Client about the
        revealed violations of its trading rules</p> <p>с) The Company should
        formulate more clearly the provisions of regulatory documents concerning
        the abuse of such kind. As an example, the following wording could be
        recommended:</p> <p><em>You consent that the Company reserves the right
        to immediately terminate your access to the trading platform(s) or
        Account(s) or refuse or cancel any order, in the event you voluntarily
        and/or involuntarily partake in arbitrage unrelated to market
        inefficiencies, including but not limited to, latency arbitrage and swap
        arbitrage and/or contrary to good faith; under such circumstances, the
        Company may at its discretion, close any of your Account(s) and recover
        any losses incurred from such practices.</em></p> <p>Based on the above,
        the members of the DRC of the Financial Commission have decided that the
        Client should be compensated in the amount of 50% of the disputed
        amount. Also, according to the general opinion of the DRC members, the
        Broker should take the necessary measures for the timely detection of
        such technical problems and their elimination in the future.</p>

        by the time of the incident:</p> <ul> <li>The total volume of Long
        positions in the financial instrument XAUUSD was equal to 0.49

        account occurred on December 4, 2023, at 01:39 (server time, UTC+2). At
        the specified time, due to the widening of spread in the financial
        instrument XAUUSD, which occurred after the short-term increase in
        market volatility, the Equity/Margin ratio on the Client’s account fell
        below the critical level. Therefore, the Broker liquidated the Client’s
        the disputed positions ## 49586486, 49596596, 49596622, 46155870,

        49699199, 49610305, 49696990, 49697606 due to lack of margin (Stop Out).
        As a result of the forced liquidation, the total amount of the
        Client&#8217;s financial losses was 16661.72 USD.</p> <p>The Client is
        not satisfied with the Broker&#8217;s decision (see below), accuses the
        Broker of misconduct and blames the Broker for the financial losses
        caused by the incident. The Client claims that in the period of the
        incident, the Broker acted unfairly by liquidating fully hedged
        positions on his account, where before the incident was 800 USD of free
        margin. In this connection, the Client requests the Dispute Resolution
        Committee to verify the correctness of the Broker’s actions in the
        period of the incident, as well as the correctness of the execution of
        the disputed transactions. The Client believes that a fair decision in
        the dispute would be monetary compensation from the Broker in the amount
        of the financial losses caused by the incident. The Client provided the
        investigation with screenshots showing the history of transactions
        performed on trading account # XXX in the period of the incident and the
        Broker’s official response to this complaint, as documentary
        evidence.</p> <p>In turn, the Broker does not see any grounds for the
        Client&#8217;s complaint, since in their opinion all Client’s positions
        were closed correctly, at actual market prices and in full compliance
        with the provisions of their regulatory documents and the trading rules
        established by the Company. The Broker provided the investigation with
        the history of trading operations performed by the Client, the server
        log records in the period of the incident, as well as the formal letter
        from the LP regarding abnormal market conditions during the incident, as
        documentary evidence.</p> <table border="1" cellspacing="0"

        <td colspan="5"><strong>Complaint Response:</strong></p> <p>The decision
        on this complaint is based on the information provided by the brokerage
        company and the Client.</p> <p>After a comprehensive analysis of the
        documentary evidence provided by the Client and the Broker the Dispute
        Resolution Committee of the Financial Commission has come to the
        following conclusions:</p> <ol> <li>First of all, it should be noted
        that the incident on the Client&#8217;s trading account occurred at the
        very beginning of the Asian trading session after the weekend. The
        Client should be aware that the market very often experiences a
        significant decrease in liquidity during this period. In turn, this
        circumstance radically changes the flow of quotes, leading to a sharp
        widening of spreads and the formation of price gaps. The Client should
        be aware that trading operations in such market conditions involve
        significant risks. In addition, the geopolitical tensions in the Middle
        East region that occurred over the weekend (<a
        href="https://apnews.com/article/red-sea-houthi-yemen-ships-attack-israel-hamas-war-gaza-strip-716770f0a780160e9abed98d3c48fbde"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a>), caused a significant
        increase in the market volatility of the financial instrument XAUUSD at
        the time of the incident.</li> </ol> <p><strong> </strong></p> <ol
        start="2"> <li>Second, the Client should take into account that even
        100% locking on trading accounts with a floating spread is impossible,
        due to the absence of a fixed difference between the Buy and Sell
        prices. In the case of position locking (which was the case in this
        case), spread widening automatically reduces the unrealized positive
        financial result on profitable positions, while increasing the
        unrealized negative financial result on unprofitable positions. In some
        market situations, spread widening can lead to undesirable consequences,
        such as Stop Out.</li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ol start="3"> <li>Third,
        according to the information received from the Broker (formal letter
        from the Broker’s Liquidity Provider regarding the abnormal market
        conditions in the period of the incident), in the period from December
        3rd 23:15:00 UTC to December 3rd 23:58:00 UTC due to the immense
        volatility in the market of the financial instrument XAUUSD during that
        period, liquidity was limited, leading to high spreads, as most
        liquidity providers halting pricing altogether. The apex of the low
        liquidity and higher spreads regime was between the times December 3rd
        23:27:00 UTC to December 3rd 23:40:00. After 23:40 prices were
        normalized and providers that halted pricing for those 13 minutes, have
        resumed their pricing.</li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ol start="4">
        <li>Fourth, the trading terms on the Client&#8217;s account suggest a
        floating spread and a Stop Out at the 40% level. This information is
        clearly defined on the Broker’s website. By opening a trading account of
        the selected type, the Client agreed to accept the trading terms
        provided by the Company. In this regard, it should be noted that
        according to the information provided by the Broker, at the time of the
        incident, the spread in the financial instrument XAUUSD had widened
        significantly. As a result, the Equity/Margin ratio on the
        Client&#8217;s account fell below the critical level (40%). As such, due
        to insufficient margin, the disputed positions ## 49586486, 49596596,
        49596622, 46155870, 48886713, 49259052, 49664998, 49674113, 48886673,
        49021139, 49044482, 49175857, 49175865, 49258891, 49693280, 49664695,
        49664989, 49693254, 49699199, 49610305, 49696990, 49697606 were
        liquidated by the Broker. This fact is confirmed by the server log
        records, provided by the Broker. In the period of the incident, the
        Broker acted in full compliance with the provisions of their regulatory
        documents:</li> </ol> <p><em>14.2. The Client shall pay the Initial
        Margin and/or Hedged Margin at the moment of opening a position. The
        amount of Initial Margin and Hedged Margin for each Instrument is
        defined in the Contract Specifications.</em></p> <p><em>…</em></p>
        <p><em>14.6. XXXXXX is entitled to close the Client’s Open Positions
        without the consent of the Client or any prior Written Notice if the
        Equity is less than a certain rate depending on the account type as
        stipulated on the Website.</em></p> <ol start="5"> <li>Finally, to
        ensure an objective investigation of the case the DRC requested
        historical price data on the financial instruments in the disputed
        transactions from other independent providers of financial services.
        Financial Commission uses several different sources, such as
        Tradeproofer, Tradefora, Verify My Trade, TrueFX, FX Benchmark and some
        others to verify the quality of trades’ execution. A comparison of the
        Broker’s quotes offered to the Client with the quotes from independent
        sources confirmed the fact that in the period of the incident the quotes
        on the financial instruments in the Client’s portfolio, published by the
        Broker reflected the actual situation on the market.</li> </ol>
        <p>Summarizing all the above and taking into account the abnormal market
        conditions during the incident, the experts of the DRC have made their
        decision in favour of the Broker. In the general opinion of the DRC
        members, at the time of the incident, the Broker acted in full
        compliance with the provisions of its regulatory documents and the
        trading rules established by the Company. The experts of the DRC found
        the execution of the disputed orders correct and legitimate since the
        quotes on the financial instruments published by the Broker were
        consistent with acceptable market prices. Accordingly, the claim of the
        Client for compensation of losses in the amount of 16661.72 USD was
        found by the members of the Committee as having no grounds.</p>

        ><![CDATA[<p><strong>Complaint Matter</strong></p> <p>Mr. XXXXX has
        lodged this complaint with the Financial Commission on the following
        grounds:</p> <p>The Client used account # XXX (USD) for active
        operations with the financial instruments of the FX market and CFDs.
        Before the incident, the Client established several positions (Long and
        Short) with different financial instruments on the specified
        account.</p> <p>Thus, by the time of the incident:</p> <ul> <li>The
        total volume of Long positions in the financial instrument XAUUSD was
        equal to 8 lots;</li> <li>The total volume of Short positions in the
        financial instrument NSD was equal to 4 lots;</li> <li>The total volume
        of Long positions in the financial instrument WTI was equal to 2
        lots;</li> <li>The total volume of Short positions in the financial
        instrument CHFJPY was equal to 1 lot;</li> <li>The total volume of Short
        positions in the financial instrument GBPCAD was equal to 11 lots.</li>
        </ul> <p>The incident on the Client’s account occurred on November 13,
        2023, at 01:30:19 (server time, UTC+2). At the specified time, due to
        the unfavourable change in the price of the financial instrument XAUUSD
        the Equity/Margin ratio on the Client’s account fell below the critical
        level. Therefore, the Client’s positions ## 30202517, 30350840,
        30542914, 30851355, 30887570, and 30905531, were liquidated by the
        Broker due to lack of Margin (Stop Out). The total amount of the
        Client’s financial losses was 3165.81 USD.</p> <p>Following the
        incident, the Broker admitted that during the period of the incident,
        the Company experienced a pricing error, that led to the erroneous
        closing of the Client’s positions. According to the Broker, the
        incorrect quote (1920.96) for the financial instrument XAUUSD was
        received from one of its liquidity providers at the close of the
        Client’s trades, and the disputed positions were closed incorrectly.
        Therefore, the Broker apologized to the Client for the inconvenience
        caused by the pricing error and offered him compensation in the amount
        of 1314.40 USD.</p> <p>The Client is not satisfied with the Broker’s
        decision on this complaint (see below), holds the Broker responsible for
        the financial losses that occurred on trading account # XXX and believes
        that the liquidated positions could have been closed with much higher
        profits if not for the pricing error on the Broker’s platform, as the
        price of the financial instrument XAUUSD reached all-time highs in a few
        days after the incident. Therefore, the Client rejects the compensation
        offered by the Broker and requests the Dispute Resolution Committee of
        the Financial Commission to verify the correctness of the Broker’s
        actions during and after the incident. In the Client’s opinion, a fair
        resolution of the dispute would be for the Broker to reinstate the
        disputed positions at the same prices or to calculate the accrued
        profits from the price difference between the previous price and the
        actual current price and deposit it into his account. The Client has
        provided the investigation with the screenshots showing the email
        communications with Broker regarding this incident, as documentary
        evidence.</p> <p>In turn, the Broker does not see any grounds for the
        Client&#8217;s complaint, since in their opinion, they acted in full
        compliance with the provisions of their regulatory documents and trading
        rules established by the Company. The Broker has provided the
        investigation with the official response to the Client’s complaint, the
        history of the Client’s trading /non-trading operations, as well as the
        history of quotes on the financial instrument XAUUSD and the server log
        records in the period of the incident, as documentary evidence.</p>

        Response:</strong></p> <p>The decision on this complaint is based on the
        information provided by the brokerage company XXXXX and Mr. XXXXX.</p>
        <p>After a comprehensive analysis of the documentary evidence provided
        by the Client and the Broker the Dispute Resolution Committee of the
        Financial Commission has come to the following conclusions:</p> <p>1.
        First of all, it should be noted that according to the information
        received from the Broker:</p> <p style="padding-left: 40px;">a) On
        13.11.2023 at 01:30:19 a non-market quote from one of the liquidity
        providers (1920.96) entered the price flow for the financial instrument
        XAUUSD.</p> <p style="padding-left: 40px;">b) As a result of the pricing
        incident the Client’s positions ## 30202517, 30350840, 30542914,
        30851355, 30887570, 30905531 were forcibly closed by Stop Out.</p> <p
        style="padding-left: 40px;">с) The Broker has credited the Client’s
        account with the compensation in the amount of 1314.40 The fact of
        compensation is confirmed by 1 balance sheet transaction # 28694941.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;">d) The amount of compensation was
        calculated by the Broker as the difference between the actual closing
        price (1920.96) of the disputed Long positions ## 30202517, 30542914,
        30851355, 30905531 and the actual market price (1937.39) available at
        the moment of the Stop Out event, that occurred at 01:30:19 (server
        time).</p> <p>In support of their position the Broker referred to the
        following provisions of the Regulations on trading operations for MT5
        accounts:</p> <p><em>9.21</em> <em>In</em> <em>the</em> <em>event</em>
        <em>of</em> <em>a</em> <em>spike</em> <em>(error</em> <em>quote) –</em>
        <em>when</em> <em>a</em> <em>non-market</em> <em>quote</em>
        <em>enters</em> <em>the</em> <em>quotes</em> <em>flow</em> <em>(a</em>
        <em>non-market</em> <em>quote means</em> <em>the</em>
        <em>following:</em> <em>a</em> <em>price</em> <em>in</em> <em>the</em>
        <em>trading</em> <em>platform</em> <em>that</em> <em>does</em>
        <em>not</em> <em>correspond</em> <em>to</em> <em>the</em>
        <em>market</em> <em>price</em> <em>at</em> <em>a</em> <em>given</em>
        <em>period </em><em>of</em><em> time; there is a significant price gap;
        the price returns to its initial position within a short period with a
        price gap </em><em>being formed; the absence of extreme price
        fluctuations preceding the formation of this quotation; the absence of
        </em><em>significant macroeconomic events and/or high-impact corporate
        news at the time of its occurrence), the Company </em><em>shall</em>
        <em>be liable for</em> <em>any</em> <em>losses</em> <em>incurred as</em>
        <em>a result</em> <em>of</em> <em>trading operations</em> <em>performed
        at this</em> <em>non-market quote,</em> <em>ie</em> <em>the Client</em>
        <em>will</em> <em>be</em> <em>fully reimbursed for</em> <em>the</em>
        <em>loss</em> <em>received</em> <em>due</em> <em>to</em> <em>a</em>
        <em>non-market</em> <em>quote.</em> <em>The</em> <em>profit</em>
        <em>received</em> <em>from</em> <em>a</em> <em>non- </em><em>market</em>
        <em>quote</em> <em>will</em> <em>be</em> <em>fully</em>
        <em>deducted</em> <em>from</em> <em>the</em> <em>Client’s</em>
        <em>trading</em> <em>account.</em></p> <p>2. Second, with regard to the
        unrealized profits on the disputed positions established with the
        financial instrument XAUUSD, which the Client claims were missed due to
        the pricing error on the Broker’s side, the following should be
        noted:</p> <p style="padding-left: 40px;">a) According to the
        documentary evidence provided by the Broker (full trading statement,
        server log records), the Client did not attach any pending Take Profit /
        Stop Loss orders to the disputed positions ## 30542914, In other words,
        the Client did not in any way indicate his intentions with respect to
        the relevant positions.</p> <p style="padding-left: 40px;">b) The same
        is true for the liquidated positions ## 30350840, 30887570 established
        with the financial instrument Nasdaq100.</p> <p style="padding-left:
        40px;">с) At the same time the disputed positions ## 30202517, 30851355
        established with the financial instrument XAUUSD were supposed to be
        closed with profits at the price levels of 2011.62 and 25 indicated by
        the Client in the relevant Take Profit orders attached to said
        positions.</p> <p style="padding-left: 40px;">d) Thus, in the absence of
        the pricing error in the Broker’s platform, the Client’s positions ##
        30202517, 30851355 would have been closed with profits in a few days
        after the incident, as the price of the financial instrument XAUUSD had
        reached its all-time high, but the rest of the disputed positions with
        no TP and SL orders attached to them (i.e. positions ## 30542914,
        30905531, 30350840, 30887570) would have continued to generate
        profits/losses.</p> <p>3. Third, to ensure an objective investigation of
        the case the DRC requested historical price data on the financial
        instrument in the disputed transactions from other independent providers
        of financial Financial Commission uses several different sources, such
        as Tradeproofer, Tradefora, Verify My Trade, TrueFX, FX Benchmark and
        some others for the purpose of verification of the quality of trades’
        execution. The comparison of the Broker’s quotes offered to the Client
        with the quotes received from independent sources confirmed the fact
        that at the time of the incident (13.11.2023, at 01:30:19, server time)
        the Bid quote (1937.39) for the financial instrument XAUUSD, used by the
        Broker to calculate the amount of compensation, reflected the actual
        situation on the market.</p> <p>4. Finally, it should be noted that the
        members of the DRC took into account the following circumstances in
        reaching their decision on this complaint:</p> <p style="padding-left:
        40px;">a) The members of the DRC admitted that the pricing error in the
        Broker’s platform disrupted the Client’s trading plans and that this
        event had a negative impact on the Client’s psychological state.</p> <p
        style="padding-left: 40px;">b) Considering the above, it should be noted
        that the Financial Commission is committed to the best business
        practices accepted throughout the industry, which assumes that if there
        is any problem caused by the broker, there should be minimum impact on
        the Client, and some solutions should be provided in a quick manner to
        mitigate negative effects of it on the Client&#8217;s positions.</p> <p
        style="padding-left: 40px;">c) The Broker partially compensated the
        Client for unrealized profits and losses that could have been avoided
        due to the system failure. Thus, in the general opinion of DRC experts,
        the Broker acted correctly, but the amount of compensation offered to
        the Client was not considered appropriate.</p> <p>Summarizing all the
        above the Dispute Resolution Committee has ruled in favor of the Client.
        Considering the circumstances of the case, as well as the documentary
        evidence provided by both parties of the dispute, the experts of the DRC
        have found the actions of the Broker in the period of the incident as
        correct and legitimate. At the same time, the experts of the DRC have
        decided that the Client should be paid additional compensation in the
        amount of unrealized profits for the disputed orders ## 30202517,
        30851355, taking into account the Client&#8217;s intentions in relation
        to the said orders, as well as the price dynamics of the financial
        instrument XAUUSD that occurred after the incident.</p> <p><em>This
